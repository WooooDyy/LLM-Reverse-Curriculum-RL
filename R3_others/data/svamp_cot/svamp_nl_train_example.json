        "answer_cot": "To determine the number of large barrels needed to hold 95 tons of oil while minimizing the number of barrels used and ensuring that every barrel is fully occupied, we can use a combination of large and small barrels.\n\nLet x be the number of large barrels used and y be the number of small barrels used. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\n6x + 5y = 95 (total amount of oil needed to be stored)\nx + y = total number of barrels used\n\nTo minimize the number of barrels used, we want to minimize x + y. We can solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\n5y = 95 - 6x\ny = (95 - 6x)/5\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx + (95 - 6x)/5 = total number of barrels used\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n\n5x + 95 - 6x = 5 * total number of barrels used\n-x + 95 = 5 * total number of barrels used\ntotal number of barrels used = (95 - x)/5\n\nTo minimize the number of barrels used, we want to minimize (95 - x)/5. This is minimized when x is maximized, since x represents the number of large barrels used. The largest integer value of x that satisfies the equation is x = 15, which gives y = 4. Therefore, we need 15 large barrels and 4 small barrels to store 95 tons of oil while minimizing the number of barrels used and ensuring that every barrel is fully occupied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <15>.",
