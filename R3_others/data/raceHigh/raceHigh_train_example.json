It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift. Many parents may even fail to recognize and respond to their children's need until discouragement explodes into uncooperative behavior. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school. Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school.\nThe five music schools in Britain aim to provide all environment where gifted children can develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians. Children here spend about half of a day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practicing in private rooms .The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths and basic sciences.\nWhat are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is that the fees are high .However, each school will often scholarships and other forms of financial aid. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at an early age .Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such a tense and disciplined environment. They stress,however, that their main aim is to turn out \"well-rounded and well--balanced individual.\"\nQuestion: What makes specialist music schools different from other schools?\nOptions: A: Their working day is longer.\nB: A range of musical training is offered\nC: More than half the day is spent on music\nD: The children have mostly one-to-one lessons",

This implies they are different from other schools because they offer specialized training for exceptionally talented students. These institutions also stress producing well-rounded individuals who can balance academic subjects and musical pursuits, which suggests that most general education school do not have this focus on holistic development as part of their mission statement (if any). The fact that parents may be hesitant about sending young kids away to such boarding school further conveys these differences between ordinary and specialised educational environments for musically inclined youths .

Nearly 2,000 wind-powered ships would cross the sea, getting seawater and sending it up through tall tubes.\n\" When you send saltwater into the air, you create bigger and whiter clouds, and thus reflect more sunlight back into space,\" said David Young from the group of the study.\n The paper by Professor Eric Bickel and Lee Lane looked into the costs of the projects. It found that cloud whitening would reduce the effects of climate change this century for no more than PS5.3 billion. This is only a small part of the PS150 billion that leading nations are considering spending to cut CO2 emissions   each year. It is also more than 25 times cheaper than the PS140 billion cost of another project which would copy the cooling effect of volcanoes. \nThe authors also compared the cost benefits that reducing temperatures would have. They found every PS1 spend on other ways would have PS15 of benefits, however every PS1 spent on cloud whitening would bring PS2,000 of benefits. These would include the human costs on health and the influence on other fields. \nDavid Young said, \"Marine cloud whitening could achieve as much for the planet as CO2cuts would, but with much less cost.\" But he warned that these techniques shouldn't be considered as a long-period way to deal with climate change.\n\" It's important to note that this technique wouldn't reduce CO2emissions or deal with the causes of global warming, but would cover its effects.\" he said.\nQuestion: Compared to other projects, cloud whitening   _  .\nOptions: A: has a greater effect on volcanoes\nB: will bring more benefits\nC: will benefit man's health most\nD: can reduce temperatures in a better way",

For many people, multitasking has become a way of life and even a key to success. In fact, some excellent mental aerobic exercises involve engaging the brain in two or more challenging activities at a time. Although checking e-mail while talking on a phone and reading the newspaper may be second nature for some people, many times multitasking can make us less productive, rather than more. And studies show that too much multitasking can lead to increased stress, anxiety and memory loss.\nIn order to multitask, the brain uses an area known as the prefrontal cortex  . Brain scans of volunteers performing multiple tasks together show that as they shift from task to task, this front part of the brain actually takes a moment of rest between tasks. You may have experienced a prefrontal cortex \"moment of rest\" yourself if you've ever dialed a phone number and suddenly forgotten who you dialed when the line is answered. What probably occurred is that between the dialing and the answering, your mind shifted to anther thought or task, and then took that \"moment\" to come back. Research has also shown that for many volunteers, job efficiency declines while multitasking, as compared to when they perform only one task at a time.\nMultitasking is easiest when at least one of the tasks is habitual, or requires little thought. Most people don't find it difficult to eat and read the newspaper at the same time. However, when two or more attention-requiring tasks are attempted at one time, people sometimes make mistakes.\nWe often don't remember things as well when we're trying to manage several details at the same time. Without mental focus, we may not pay enough attention to new information coming in, so it never makes it into our memory stores. That is one of the main reasons we forget people's names--even sometimes right after they have introduced themselves. Multitasking can also affect our relationships.

And while researchers can't be sure that playing less is directly to blame, they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise. The Bristol University study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day.  Half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session.\nMark Evans, former chief vet for the RSPCA, said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood.  He told the Sunday Times: 'There is a clear association in the results.  Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.'\nEmily Blackwell -- who conducted the research uncovered tonight on Channel 4's Dogs: Their Secret Lives - said dogs often enjoy playing so much that they slow down or change strategy to make the fun last longer. The lecturer in canine  welfare hopes that 10,000 people will eventually fill out the survey. This will enable her to firmly establish whether lack of play is affecting dogs' moods - or if their emotional problems put their owners off spending time with them.  For instance,they may slow down when playing 'chase', allowing their owner to catch up with them and the game to continue. Favourite games include wrestling, chase and tugging at toys, and perhaps unsurprisingly,'fetch' topped the list. Tennis balls were the favourite toys, followed by soft, squeaky toys, rubber balls and rope toys.\nThe research comes just days after an animal charity warned that millions of dogs are becoming fat. aggressive and destructive because their owners are clueless about basic animal care.The PDSA said that treats including beer, chips and leftover takeaways are making dogs fat and unwell - and wamed that almost a million are never taken for a walk.\nQuestion: If the dogs are not looked after carefully,  _  .\nOptions: A: they may become rebelling and damaging\nB: they may get hurt and run away from home\nC: they may become less active and dislike playing with the owners\nD: they are more likely to fight with other animals",

        "output": "The article mentions that dogs are becoming anxious and aggressive (A) through lack of play, which means they don't get enough exercise. The PDSA also says that treats like beer and chips make them fat (C), so as a result, the owners may not want to take their dogs for walks or do anything fun with them anymore. Therefore, if the dogs aren't cared for properly by being fed healthy diets and taken outside more often then eventually they will become unruly because no one wants to spend time with an obese dog who is always getting into trouble.\nSo the answer is A ### A"

One of these, for example, was the great Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci. In the sixteenth century he made designs for machines that could fly. But they were never built.,\nThroughout history, other less famous men have wanted to fly. An example was a man in England 800years ago. He made a pair of wings from chicken feathers. Then he fixed them to his body and jumped into the air from a tall building. He did not fly very far. He fell to the ground and broke every bone in his body.\nThe first real step took place in France in 1783. Two brothers, the Mongolfiers, made a very large \"hot air balloon\". They knew that hot air rises. Why not fill a balloon with it? The balloon was made of cloth and paper. In September of that year, the King and Queen of France came to see the balloon. They watched it carry the very first air passengers into the sky. The passengers were a sheep and a chicken. We do not know how they felt about the trip. But we do know that the trip lasted 8 minutes and that the animals landed safely. Two months later, two men did the same thing. They rose above Paris in a balloon of the same kind.

Thus,marriage remains by far the preferred way of life for the vast majority of people in our society.\nWhat has changed more than marriage is the nuclear family.Twenty five years ago,the typical American family was made up of a husband,a wife,and two or three children. Now there are many marriages in which couples have decided not to have any children.And there are many marriages where at least some of the children are from the wife's former marriage,or the husband's,or both.Sometimes these children spend all of their time with one parent from the former marriage;sometimes they are shared between the two former spouses .\nThus,one can find every type of family arrangement.There are marriages without children;Marriages with children from only the present marriage;Marriages with \"full time\" children from both the present and former marriages;Marriages with \"full time\" children from the present marriage and \"part time\",children from former marriages.There are stepfathers,stepmothers,half brothers, and half sisters.It is not all that unusual for a child to have four parents and eight grandparents!

That's what's happening to the West Antarctic ice sheet . A new study reveals that the area under the ice sheet is far hotter than previously thought, fed by an unexpected flow of geothermal energy . While the CO2we send out heats the atmosphere above the continent, earth is melting us ice from below.\nIf you were to drill   deep at some place on the continents, you would find that the temperature increases about 25degC for every kilometer deep into the hole on average. Scientists call this the geothermal gradient . Until recently, no one had drilled deeply enough through the West Antarctic ice to determine the geothermal gradient underground. For the new study, researchers drilled all the way through the ice and into the mud. They found that the geothermal gradient was about 200degC, which is several times the global average on continents. Few predicted this result, although it had been showed that the earth below the West Antarctic ice is unusually hot.\nEven with the new discovery, though, we still don't know exactly where the heat is coming from. One interesting possibility is volcanoes, which are under the ice. As recently as 2013, scientists were still discovering volcanoes under the ice in the area, and there may be many more.\nSome people say that these volcanoes, rather than manmade climate change, are responsible for melting the area's ice. While it's true that heat coming from within the earth, including heat related to volcanoes, makes the melting faster, it is just one contributor to the loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet---not the main cause.

After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few \"innies\".\nUnlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically  motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard.\nBeing shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they \"own\" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image.\nShyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements.

Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved.\nWhen my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced.\nAs a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. \"Animals belong in the wild,\" is a common -- and understandable -- complaint.

        "instruction": "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Winter weather has returned to northern areas of the world. In much of the United States, winter means the return of snow.\nSnow is a form of frozen water. It contains many groups of tiny ice particles ( ) called snow crystals ( ) . These crystals grow from water particles in cold clouds. They usually grow around a piece of dust. All snow crystals have six sides, but they grow in different shapes. The shape depends mainly on the temperature and water levels in the air. The shape of a snow crystal may change from one form to another as the crystal passes through levels of air with different temperatures. Snow contains much less water than rain. About seventy-five centimeters of snow has as much water as two and one-half centimeters of rain.\nGenerally, the color1 of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected ( ). Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white color1.\nMuch of the water we use comes from snow. Melting snow gives water to rivers and crops. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold. Fresh snow is made largely of air which is kept among the snow crystals. Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is greatly reduced. However, snow is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people in the United States every year. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads that are covered with snow or ice.\nQuestion: How can snow protect plants from the cold?\nOptions: A: It gives them much heat.\nB: It has a higher temperature.\nC: It keeps them from wind.\nD: It contains air which helps hold heat.",

Option D captures this idea best: it holds back wind and keeps heat close to plant roots. \n\n\nSo option D would be considered as correct answer. ### D"

The origins of most of the days are unknown. They were certainly not created by individual people. Other days, however, especially those celebrated in western countries, often owe their origins to a particular person. One of the most popular of these, even though it is fairly recent, is Mother's Day. Mothers have always been highly regarded in all cultures. The ancient Romans had a festival known as Hilaria, during which children took presents to the temple of the \"Mother of the Gods\". The Christian Church adopted this idea and called it Mothering Sunday. However, over the years this custom was gradually forgotten and almost disappeared by the end of the 19th century.\nBorn in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers.\nIn 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States.\nSoon there was a Mother's Day International Association and the custom began to be adopted in many countries of the world.\nAnna Jarvis, a sad and disillusioned  woman, died in 1948. The custom she had worked so hard to establish and which had become almost universal had lost its original purpose. It had been taken over by business. Like Christmas, the giving of presents and the sending of cards had become a multi-million-dollar industry.\nQuestion: Unfortunately, Anna Jarvis was not happy with Mother's Day when she died because    _    .\nOptions: A: her mother was not there to see it\nB: she had never been a mother herself\nC: people were too interested in making it a business\nD: no one gave any presents or cards to their mothers",

You think about a problem until you're tired, forget it, maybe sleep on it, and then flash! When you aren't thinking about it, suddenly the answer arrives as a gift from the gods. \nOf course, all ideas don't occur like that but so many do, particularly the most important ones. They burst into the mind, glowing with the heat of creation. How they do it is a mystery but they must come from somewhere. Let's assume they come from the \"unconscious.\" This is reasonable, for psychologists use this term to describe mental processes which are unknown to the individual. Creative thought depends on what was unknown becoming known.\nAll of us have experienced this sudden arrival of a new idea, but it is easiest to examine it in the great creative personalities, many of whom experienced it in an intensified form and have written it down in their life stories and letters. One can draw examples from genius in any field, from religion, philosophy, and literature to art and music, even in mathematics, science, and technical invention, although these are often thought to depend only on logic and experiment. All truly creative activities depend in some degree on these signals from the unconscious, and the more highly insightful the person is, the sharper and more dramatic the signals become.\nA type of creative experience is illustrated by the dreams which came to Descartes at the age of twenty-three and determined his life path. Descartes had unsuccessfully searched for certainty, first in the world of books, and then in the world of men. Then in a dream on November 10, 1619, he made the significant discovery that he could only find certainty in his own thoughts, cogito ergo sum (\"I think; therefore, I exist\").

That saying holds true not only for you and me, but also for some of the most powerful and influential people in the world, such as the presidents of the United States.\nBut how do American presidents spend their vacation time? Let's take a look!\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, considered one of the greatest presidents in American history, had limited vacation options because of his polio . He began visiting Warm Springs, Georgia in 1924 for its curative waters and later built a 2,000 acre polio treatment center nearby. He liked to cruise the Potomacon his yacht  and three times as president returned to his beloved Canadian island of Campobello, with which he fell in love as a kid.\nFormer President Bill Clinton, however, was never much good at vacationing. His staff had to practically force him to go on vacation his first year in office; his idea of relaxing was reading four good books simultaneously  while enjoying a cigar (chewed, not smoked). He could also lose himself in a game of golf, where his somewhat flexible interpretation of the rules could at times drive his partners crazy.\nObama's predecessor  also knows how to relax. Fishing is in the Bush family DNA: for blue sharks off the coast of Maine or anything with fins, almost anywhere else. George W. Bush also relaxed as president by jogging and clearing brush on his Texas ranch. Since leaving office, he has become an active mountain biker and, more recently, has taken up painting.\nObama tends to take a winter break in Hawaii, where he was born and raised, and a summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard, off the southern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In between, he plays basketball every couple of weeks and has been known to do some skeet shooting at Camp David.

Doesn't it? If you think so, you're not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession .\n\"Energy independence\" and its rhetorical  companion \"energy security\" are, however, unreliable concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it that we want independence from, exactly?\nMost people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere.\nThe first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle  of biofuel  available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.\nSecond, Americans have basically decided that they don't really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to tolerate the environmental influence of domestic  energy production in order to cut back imports?\nThird, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don't read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.\nThere is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to keep its economy stable.

He is not just the world's foremost expert on the social behavior of ants, but also the receiver of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction. Now, at the age of 80, Wilson has tried his hand at fiction. His first novel, Anthill, combines two of his greatest loves -- his childhood home, Alabama, and the ants that have been his lifelong friends. \nDescribed as a \"six-legged Iliad,\" Wilson's Anthill draws parallels between human and ant societies. Though there are no ant bands, secret police, or schools of philosophy, both ants and man conduct wars, divide themselves into specialized classes of workers, build cities, maintain infant nurseries and cemeteries, take slaves and practice agriculture, though ant societies are more energetic, selfless, and efficient than human ones.\nThe book's first and third sections deal with the adventures of an Alabama boy, Raphael    Semmes Cody, who goes by the name Raff.

Instead, it is a summer course.\nThe course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practise driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license.\nDriving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practise starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two-hour blocks of time.

Almost at once, we notice his appearance, style of dress, and manner of speech. Furthermore (besides), as we listen to what he has to say and observe the things he does, we begin to form some ideas of what kind of person he is and what he intends to do. As you know from your own experience, though, we do not only gather these separate pieces of information. Instead, we go further and combine them into a unified   picture. In short, we form an overall impression of each person we meet--an impression that can be favorable (making people like) or unfavorable. But how precisely (exactly) do we perform this task? How do we combine so much different information into a clear first impression with such quick speed? A great deal of research has been performed on this question, and results point to the following answer: we perform this task through a special type of averaging  .\n       Expressed very simply, our impressions of others seem to represent a weighted average of all information that can be gathered about them. That is, they reflect a process in which all information we have about others is averaged together--but with some facts, or input   receiving greater weight than others. As you can readily see, this makes good sense. For example, in forming an impression of a new boss you would probably be affected to a much greater degree by how this person gives you orders (whether respectfully or not) than by the color1 of his or her eyes. The fact that not all information about other persons affects our impressions of them to the same degree, raises an important question. Just what kinds of input receive the greatest weight? Again research provides some revealing   answers.\nQuestion: According to the passage, the first impression is   _  .\nOptions: A: the result of quick look\nB: not based on enough information\nC: a combination of pieces of information\nD: the observation of what a person does",

By protecting habitat, entire communities of animals can be protected together naturally. _ \n2.

Some societies, such as America and Australia for example, are mobile and very open. People here change jobs and move house quite often. As a result, they have a lot of relationships that often last only a short time, and they need to get to know people quickly. So it's normal to have friendly conversations with people that they have just met, and you can talk about things that other cultures would regard as personal.\nOn the other hand there are more crowded and less mobile societies where long-term relationships are more important. A Malaysian or Mexican business person, for example, will want to get to know you very well before he or she feels happy to start business. But when you do get to know each other, the relationship becomes much deeper than it would in a mobile society.\nTo Americans, both Europeans and Asians seem cool and formal at first. On the other hand, as a passenger from a less mobile society puts it, it's no fun spending several hours next to a stranger who wants to tell you all about his or her life and asks you all sorts of questions that you don't want to answer.\nCross-cultural differences aren't just a problem for travelers, but also for the flights that carry them. All flights want to provide the best service, but ideas about good service are different from place to place. This can be seen most clearly in the way that problems are dealt with.\nSome societies have 'universalist' cultures. These societies strongly respect rules, and they treat every person and situation in basically the same way.\n'Particularist' societies, on the other hand, also have rules, but they are less important than the society's unwrinen ideas about what is right or wrong for a particular situation or a particular person. So the normal rules are changed to fit the needs of the situation or the importance of the person.\nThis difference can cause problems. A traveler from a particularist society, India, is checking in for a flight in Germany, a...\nQuestion: Which of the following is true about \"particularist societies\"?\nOptions: A: There is no rule for people to obey.\nB: People obey the society's rules completely.\nC: No one obeys the society's ruies though they have.\nD: The society's rules can be changed with different persons or situations.",

Online schools receive the same amount of funding as all other public schools, even though they don't have to pay for rent or school equipment. States should use their educational funds to improve education at real schools, not to support online programs.\nSome students only use online classes to supplement their school work. They benefit from the social experience of a traditional high school, while still taking online courses.\nHowever, about 90 thousand students in America receive their education only from online schools. 50 thousand of these students take courses at Florida Virtual School, the largest online school in the country. While this method of schooling helps students who live in remote regions, most school systems are upset that they are losing more students each year to these online programs.\nAlthough online learning allows children to work at their own pace, these online schools have only one teacher per several hundred students. Often, teachers can't give struggling students the help they need as they are unable to talk face-to-face with them, to find exactly what they're having difficulty with.\nAdditionally, even though online schooling accommodates   students who live in more remote states, students in online programs may suffer in social situations because they will not learn valuable communication skills from their schooling. Similar to students who are home schooled, those who take only online classes won't learn social etiquette  , and will be treated differently by their peers.\nOnline schooling might be useful for places where there are not enough students for a real school, such as agricultural regions, but states should only spend taxpayers' money on online schools in extreme cases.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly about?\nOptions: A: Whether students should study at online schools.\nB: Whether online schools should be allowed to exist.\nC: Whether taxpayers should pay for online schools.\nD: Whether traditional schools should be replaced.",

Three-D printers are used to make everything from automobile parts to bone replacements for human patients. American research scientists are now working on creating replacements for living tissue.\nResearchers at the Medical University of South Carolina have been working on creating and manufacturing living tissue since 2003.This process is called biofabrication   . It requires special printing equipment and a special kind of ink.\nTraditional printers require ink to produce an image or design on a piece of paper. For their three-D printer, the South Carolina researchers prepare complex nutritious solutions they call bio-inks. Bio-inks are made of proteins and glucose   , which normally provides energy for most cells of the body. The researchers also add living cells taken from the animal that will receive the new, printed tissue. The bio-inks are then added to a device that researchers call the Palmetto bio-printer.\nSarah Grace Dennis is one of the researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina. She says new technology, like the Palmetto bio-printer, is a great help to the biofabrication process.\nThe bio-inks are placed in three dispensers   , containers, inside the printer. Lasers control both the position of the printing surface and the places where the bio-ink is released.\nMichael Yost is a leader of the research team. He says the printing process is fully automated-- machine-operated. He says that the Palmetto bio-printer makes it possible to create complex tissue types.\nThe researchers say bio-printing is still experimental.

Lots of people have trouble getting used to it and this can affect their confidence.\nSome people think they need to change how they look or act to feel good about themselves. But actually all you need to do is change the way you see your body and how you think about yourself.\nThe first thing to do is recognize that your body is your own, no matter what shape, size, or color it comes in. If you're very worried about your weight or size, go to your doctor to check that things are OK. But it's no one's business but your own what your body is like-finally, you have to be happy with yourself.Next, find which aspects of your appearance you can change and which you can't change and need to accept-like their height, for example, or their shoe size.\nIf there are things about yourself that you want to change and can do this by making goals for yourself.

The first consideration when purchasing plants is to make reasonably sure that they are suitable for the condition in which they are going to be housed.\nA general rule for most plans being brought indoors for the first time is to ensure that they have reasonable temperature of not less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit,a position out of cold air,safe from pets and not exposed to strong sunlight.\nPlants love company. When plants are growing together,they create an atmosphere of damp around themselves which is far more beneficial than hot dry conditions. A group of plants will also present a more pleasing picture and provide an opportunity for a creative arrangement. There is no secret to this. Just rely on your natural feeling for harmony.\nWatering and feeding plants are probably the two areas of care that are the least well understood,but,again,if you follow a few simple rules,your plants should do well. Cold Slightly warm water is therefore the answer. It is usually better to pour water on to the soil on the surface of the pot rather than put the water into the pot holder at the bottom. Avoid giving small amount of water at regular intervals- it is much better to wet the soil right through the pot in one go and then to allow it to dry noticeably before giving it a further watering.\nThe majority of indoor plants will be in active growth from March until October,and during this time,the established ones will benefit from regular feeding. This may mean feeding with a weak liquid fertilizer  at each watering or at intervals of a week or ten days with fertilizer at a standard strength.

A young girl was sitting on the ground, reading next to the booth. \n   My father cleared his throat and asked,'How much are the oranges?'\n   The girl jumped up and asked,'Oh....what?'\n   'How much are the oranges?' my father repeated patiently.\n   'Oh......two for one yuan ,'the girl answered politely.

You've never heard of Lorenzo Bertolla, but those girls looked really stylish . They must know. So, you buy it. You never realize that those young women are employees of an advertising agency. They are actually paid to go from store to store, talking loudly about Lorenzo Bertolla clothes.\nEvery day we notice what people are wearing, driving and eating. If the person looks cool, the product seems cool, too. This is the secret of undercover marketing. Companies from Ford to Nike are starting to use it.\nUndercover marketing is important because it reaches people that don't pay attention to traditional advertising. This is particularly true of the MTV generation -- consumers between the age of 18 and 34. It's a golden group. They have a lot of money to spend, but they don't believe in ads.\nSo advertising agencies hire young actors to \"perform\" in bars and other places where young adults go.

Cleaning up the air, while good for our lungs, could make global warming worse. And the pollutants still go up around the air, along with carbon dioxide.\nThese pollutants are called aerosols   and they include soot as well as mixtures of nitrogen  and sulfur  and other stuff into the air. Natalie Mahowald, a climate researcher at Cornell University, says so far, scientists have mostly tried to understand what those aerosols do while they're actually in the air.\n\"There are so many different kinds of aerosols,\" she says. \"Some warm and some cool. But in fact, humans are giving out a lot of extra aerosols, and they tend to cool for the most part.\"\nThe aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, or keep us cool. But it turns out that's not all they do. These aerosols also influence how much carbon dioxide gets drawn out of the air by plants on land and in the sea.\n\"They can add nutrients, for example, to the oceans or to the land,\" Mahowald says. \"But also while they're in the atmosphere they can change the climate, and thus that also can influence the amount of carbon, the land or the ocean can take up. So there are quite a few different ways that aerosols can act on each other.\"\nMahowald's results suggest that reducing those pollutants could be an even bigger problem than realized, when you consider that aerosols help remove carbon dioxide from the air by encouraging plant growth. Hard numbers on this effect are highly uncertain at the moment, but this could turn out to be quite significant.\nAnd studying it is not easy because the effects aren't well understood. For example, nitrogen can be a fertilizer  , but it can stop plant growing when nitrogen comes out of the air in acid form. \nRight now it seems like we're much more likely to clean up aerosol pollution, while increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. So scientists, unfortunately, may have a chance to see whether this experiment on our planet should continue or not.\nQuestion: What does the last sentence of the passage imply?\nOptions: A: Scientists will be in a dilemma.\nB: The experiment will be successful.\nC: Scientists will carry out the experiment.\nD: Scientists have difficulty in the experiment.",

Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to regret and prepare for Christ's death and coming back to life.\nModern Brazilian Carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, later taking in elements of Native American and African cultures.\nIn the late 19th century, the strings   were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant   groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as blocks, consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are generally connected with particular neighborhoods; they include both a music group and a lot of revelers.\nBlock parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, they number more than 100 and the groups increase each year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a square, then parade in sections of the city, often near the beach.\nCarnival time in Rio is very interesting, but is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other lodgings   can be up to four times more expensive than the regular rates. There are big crowds at some locations and life is far from ordinary in many parts of town.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly about?\nOptions: A: The famous carnivals in the world.\nB: How the carnival was introduced in Brazil.\nC: The carnival in Rio de Janeiro.\nD: The happy life of the people in Rio de Janeiro.",

Tina grew up in the U.S. Wesley grew up in Taiwan. And they have discovered that differences between Chinese and American cultures extend   to every area of life. Even sickness and health.\nWhen Westerners experience pain, they usually express their discomfort. Most Asians don't. This creates a challenge for American nurses who care for Asian patients in the U.S. How do they know if that calm, quiet patient is really hurting?

Manyrestaurants have joined the program by announcing that customers are encouraged to order half a dish andtake home what they can't finish.\nHowever, it is estimated   that 50 million tons of grain are wasted every year in China, enough tofeed 200 million people for a year.\nTrue, official banquets   paid with public money contribute much to such waste. But it isimportant that everyone thinks about how they can do their bit to reduce food waste. We need to developthe habit of never ordering or cooking more than we can eat and feeling guilty when we dump ourleftovers.\nMany people have a bad habit of entertaining guests with more than enough food, believing that theyhave not satisfied their guests' appetites if there is no food left on the table.

But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe.\nPrevious studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \"moderate\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure.\nThe authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.\nQuestion: What can we learn from the text?\nOptions: A: Eating fatty food has immediate effects on your heart.\nB: The EPA conducted many studies on air quality.\nC: Moderate air quality is more harmful than smoking,\nD: Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made.",

When you are at work, you take a break to have a moment alone with it. When you get in to a lift, you play with it.\nCigarette? Cup of coffee? No, it's the third most addictive thing in modern life, the cell phone. Experts say that it is becoming more difficult for many people to curb their longing to hug it more tightly than most of their personal relationships. \nWith its shiny surface and its smooth and satisfying touch, the cell phone connects us to the world even as it disconnects us from people three feet away. In just the past couple of years, the cell phone has challenged people in ways its inventors in the late 1940s never imagined.\nThe costs are becoming even more obvious, and I don't mean just the monthly bill. Dr. Chris Knippers, working at the Betty Ford Center in Southern California, reports that the overuse of cell phones has become a social problem not much different from other harmful addictions: a problem that limits one-on-one personal contact, and an escape from reality. \nSounds extreme, but we've all witnessed the evidence: the person at restaurant who talks on the phone through an entire meal, ignoring his kids around the table; the women who talks on the phone in the car, ignoring her husband; the teen who texts messages all the way home from school, avoiding contact with kids all around him.\nIs it just rude, or is it a kind of unhealthiness? And pardon me, but how is this improving the quality of life?\nJim Williams, an industrial sociologist based in Massachusetts, notes that cell-phone addiction\nis part of a set of symptoms in a widening gulf of personal separation. He points to a study by Duke University researchers that found one-quarter of Americans say they have no one to discuss their most important personal business with,Williams says studies show that we don't have as many friends as our parents.\"Just as more information has led to less wisdom,more acquaintances via the Internet and cell phones have...\nQuestion: The example of a woman talking on the phone in the car supports the idea that  _\nOptions: A: women use cell phones more often than men\nB: talking on the phone while driving is dangerous\nC: cell phones make one-on-one personal contact easy\nD: cell phones do not necessarily bring people together",

His sister Michaely, 6 years old, still likes dressing her Barbies. But once she starts playing Game Boy, it's hard to get her away.\nPlay patterns like this could take up another Christmas for the toy department. Through September, toy sales were down 5% compared with the first nine months of last year, according to the NDP Group. Meanwhile, the video-game industry is heading for another record year. Thanks to hot new games like Halo 2 for the Xbox, the industry is light-years ahead of the toy business when it comes out.\nWhile some new toys emerge every holiday season, toymakers are heading into this one without a monster hit  . Indeed, there has not been a Furby-style frenzy   in years. Of 10 toy segments only two, arts and crafts and dolls, have generated sales growth over a recent 12-month period.

The fact that kids are growing more tech-savvy  , a trend called \"age compression  \", has troubled toy companies for at least a decade.

But touching things can help you to see them better. Your eyes can tell you that a glass ball is round. But by holding it in your hands, you can feel how smooth and cool the ball is. You can feel how heavy the glass is. When you feel all these about the ball, you really see it. With your skin, you can feel better. For example, your fingers can tell the difference between two coins in your pocket. You can feel a little drop of water on the back of your hand, too.\nAll children soon learn what \"Don't touch!\" means. They hear it often. Yet most of us keep on touching things as we grow up. In shops, we touch things as we might buy: food, clothes. To see something well, we have to touch it.\nThere are ways of learning to see well by feeling. One way is to close your eyes and try to feel everything that is touching your skin. Feel the shoes on your feet, the clothes on your body, the air on your skin. At first, it is not easy to feel these things. You are too used to them!\nMost museums are just for looking. But today some museums have some things to touch. There you can feel everything on show.

When a round cheese is rolled, competitors run down the hill and try to catch it before it reaches the bottom. As the cheese can reach speeds of up to 112 km/h, it's rare that someone catches the cheese. First to the bottom wins the cheese. But running down a very steep  hill behind a cheese can be dangerous. Eight people were injured in 1992.\nRoswell UFO festival (New Mexico, US)\nThe Roswell UFO festival celebrates the anniversary  of the \"Roswell Incident\", when a UFO was said to have crashed  nearby. Every year in July, experts, authors, researches and lecturers come to discuss the incident. The celebration also includes an alien parade, an alien costume contest, and an alien hot air balloon ride.\nHemingway Days (Florida, US)\nThis festival has normal stuff (,) like short-story readings and exhibits about the author.

Their style of painting is called Impressionism. They used primary colors and short brush strokes  in their work. They recognized Mary 's spirit and powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows.\nMary painted what she saw: gardens, and paintings of persons , especially of mothers and children involved in everyday living. One of her paintings, \"Young Mother and Two Children,\" was given to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today.\nMary never married and, in 1877, her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her.

In people with AIDS, that increase in temperature kills some heat-sensitive HIV, the virus, most doctors say, causes AIDS.\nHeating the blood of AIDS patients has been tried before, say doctors. But during previous attempts, the treatment induced deadly chemical changes in the blood. The Biologic-HT System prevents those changes from happening, allowing the heat to kill viruses with few ill side effects.\nThe new heat treatment cannot be considered a cure for Aids, says president of the company that makes the system. He says the treatment doesn't kill all traces of the virus. However, it kills enough virus particles to give a patient's immune system a reprieve in its deadly duel with HIV.\nTests of the Biologic-HT treatment began on 36 patients earlier this year. The treatment takes about four hours, and the patient normally feels well enough to leave the hospital or clinic the following morning.\nSo far, the patients who have had the treatment say they feel better and have developed no new opportunistic infections--disease that strike people with damaged immune systems. The patients also have experienced about a 50 percent increase in the number of T cells in their bodies. T cells are key disease-fighting cells of the immune system and the main target of HIV.\nQuestion: According to the passage, the new treatment  _  .\nOptions: A: can kill all the HIV viruses\nB: cannot eliminate the viruses completely\nC: can double the number of disease-fighting cells\nD: can reconstruct the patient's immune system.",

People like popular things and feel that they can only find the latest styles in the city.\nHowever, it is possible to enjoy the higher quality of country life and still enjoy some of the advantages of living in the city.\nNowadays, traveling is fast and easy, and information can be found on the Internet, so many people are able to do their work in home offices. Because they have e-mail and personal computers, they don't have to be in big cities to manage their businesses. It is not important where they actually work because the results of their work can be sent everywhere with e-mails. Therefore, there is no need to put up with all of the disadvantages of the city.

Sometimes it is the ordinary nature of these objects that actually makes them so extraordinary. Such is the case with an old leather shoe in a museum in Alaska. At first glance it does not look like much. It is a woman's shoe of a style popular in the 1890s. But what is unique  about this shoe is where it was found. It was discovered on the Checkout Pass, the famous trail used by the people seeking gold in Alaska. Who it belonged to or why it was left there is not known. Was it perhaps dropped by accident as the woman climbed up the 1500 stairs carved outface? Or did she throw away goods that she didn't need in order to travel lighter?\nOver 100, 000 people with \"gold fever\" made this trip hoping to become millionaires. Few of them understood that on their way they would have to cross a harsh wildness. Unprepared for such a dangerous journey, many died of starvation and exposure to the cold weather.\nThe Canadian government finally started requiring the gold seekers to bring one ton of supplies with them. This was thought to be enough for a person to survive for one year. They would carry their supplies in backpacks  each weighing up to fifty pounds; it usually took at least 40 trips to get everything to the top and over the pass. Whoever dropped the shoe must have been a brave and determined woman. Perhaps she was successful and made it to Alaska. Perhaps she had to turn back in defeat. No one will ever know for sure, but what we do know is that she took part in one of the greatest adventures in the 19th century.\nQuestion: No matter what happened to the woman who owned the shoe,   _  .\nOptions: A: she must have lived a happy life\nB: she certainly dropped the shoe on purpose\nC: her adventurous spirit is definitely admired\nD: her other shoes were equally fashionable",

The name, Philadelphia, which means\"brotherly love\", is an ancient name that can be found in the Bible. Late in the 17th century, Philadelphia's founding father, William Penn, borrowed the name because its meaning represented his own beliefs.\nOur first stop will be the Franklin Institute which is one of the country's best science museums.

It's the most visited museum and surely the most fun. Benjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Also Franklin was a leading author, printer, politician, scientist, musician, inventor, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He earned the title of\"The First American\"for his campaigning for colonial unity; as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies, then as the first United States Ambassador to France, he contributed much to the building of the American nation.\nWe won't miss Please Touch Museum too.

In other countries, this is not a problem: in America, where a queue-jumper has committed a kind of rudeness rather than a sin, the response is a loud warning: the offender is simply told \"Hey, you, get back in line!\" or words to that effect. On the European continent, the reaction tends to be loud and argumentative; in some other parts of the world, queue-jumpers may simply be pushed back into line. Ironically  , it is only in England, where queue-jumping is regarded as deeply immoral, that the queue-jumper is likely to get away with the offence. Only rarely do the English actually speak up and tell the jumper to go to the back of the queue.\nQueuing is almost a national pastime for the English, who automatically arrange themselves into orderly lines at bus stops, shop counters, ice-cream vans, entrances, exits, and lifts. In 1946, a Hungarian humorist described queuing as English \"national passion\". \"On the continent,\" he said. \"if people are waiting at a bus stop they walk around in a seemingly relaxed fashion. When the bus arrives they make a dash   for it...An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms orderly queue of one.\" In an update over thirty years later in 1977 he confirmed that this was still the case. After nearly another thirty years nothing much seems to have changed.\nIn many cases, queue-jumping is effectively prevented by non-verbal   signals alone.

But with a little effort, you can forget it much faster, often within a day or two.\nWalk it off\nExercise is the most popular bad-mood buster. A person who's in a bad mood has low energy and high tension. Taking a fast ten-minute walk, or taking some quick exercise can do wonders towards changing that bad mood.\nTune it out\nListening to your favorite music for a while can also make tensions go away quickly, because music starts associations with past positive experiences we've had.\nGive yourself a pep talk\nStop and listen to what's on your mind. Bad moods are often started by too many negative thoughts. Write them all down on paper, including the pessimistic messages you've been giving yourself and then give optimistic answers.(\"I still don't have a job.\" Vs\" I have two interviews next week.\")\nReduce your stress\nRelaxation techniques are wonderful mood-lifters. There include de3ep breathing, stretching and visualizing, all of which sound complicated but aren't. One easy way to visualize, close your eyes and picture a favorite place, such as the beach. Another simple way to unhappiness is to make a to-do list. One reason for being in a bad mood is feeling you have no options. By taking control over certain areas, you realize you're not helpless. You can make changes in your mood and life.\nAvoid things that won't improve your mood\nTV may not help much: you need to increase your energy level and stimulate your mind-something that the TV show \"Neighbors\" won't do. And before you reach for that piece of cake and coffee, think about how mood and food are linked. Sugar and caffeine contribute to depressed moods. The better choice? Research shows that carbohydrates, such as potatoes and pasta , produce a calming effect on people who have a desire for them.\nQuestion: What can we infer from the passage?\nOptions: A: You don't have to be nice to your neighbors\nB: you often feel powerful when in bad mood\nC: Some TV shows won't energize you\nD: Slow exercise can gets you out of bad mood",

They were busy counting wild birds on Mount Vernon's wetlands, south of Washington, D.C. They began in the middle of December and worked until the beginning of January, 2015.\nThe birdwatchers were among 70,000 volunteers who collected information for the National Audubon Society, a U.S. conservation group. They counted birds in more than 2,400 areas in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean Sea and other parts of the Americas.\nThe Audubon Society's first \"Christmas Bird Count\" took place 115 years ago in 1900. At that time, a man named Frank Chapman suggested a new Christmas tradition that people count birds instead of shooting them around the holiday.\nHarry Glasgow has taken part in the Christmas Bird Count for the past 10 years.

The impacts sort of cut across all birds, all sizes, all kinds, all places.\"\nInformation from the bird counts has shown that birds are staying farther north during the winter months because of warmer weather. Birdwatcher Jaime Reidy has noted the difference close to Washington, in the state of Virginia.\n\"You get to see them at odd times of the year, a little earlier, staying a little later.\"\nGary Langham says other conditions are affecting bird populations.\n\"You can imagine the birds that live along the beach or along the rocky shore line as sea levels are rising around the world.

The trees in the school yard would be in full leaf again and the old leaves would be lying around like a muddy sea of leaves.\n\"Get that all swept up!\" the headmaster would tell us. \"I want the whole place cleaned up, at once!\" There was enough work there, to last over a week. Especially since the only tools with which we were provided were our hands, our fingers, and our nails. \"Now see that it's done properly, and be quick about it,\" the headmaster would say to the older pupils, \"or you'll have to answer for it!\"\nSo at an order from the older boys we would all line up like peanuts about to cut and gather in crops. If the work was not going as quickly as the headmaster expected, the big boys, instead of giving us a helping hand, used to find it simpler to beat us with branches pulled from the trees. In order to avoid these blows , we used to bribe  the older boys with the juicy cakes we used to bring for our midday meals. And if we happened to have any money on us, the coins changed hands at once. If we did not do this, if we were afraid of going home with an empty stomach or an empty purse, the blows were redoubled. They hit us so violently and with such evil enjoyment that even a deaf and dumb person would have realized that we were being whipped  not so much to make us work harder, but rather to beat us into a state of obedience  in which we would be only too glad to give up our food and money.\nOccasionally one of us, worn out by such calculated cruelty, would have the courage to complain to the headmaster. He would of course be very angry, but the punishment he gave the older boys was always very small--nothing compared to what they had done to us. And the fact is that however much we complained, our situation did not improve in the slightest.

With their huge, wedge-shaped heads and silver-dollar-size brown eyes, the 2,000-pound animals are symbols of another place and time. More than 100 bison now roam the 30,000-acre American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana -- the first time they've inhabited that region in a century. Direct descendants of the tens of millions of bison that once populated the Western plains, they represent an epic effort: to restore a piece of America's prairie to the national grandeur that Lewis and Clark extolled two centuries ago. During that famous expedition across the Western states to the Pacific, the two explorers encountered so many bison that they had to wait hours for one herd to pass.\nIn order to protect what's here and reintroduce long-gone wildlife (something the World Wildlife Fund is helping with), the American Prairie Foundation began purchasing land from local ranchers in 2004. It now owns 30,000 acres and has grazing privileges on another 57,000. Its goal over the next 25 years is to assemble three million acres, the largest area of land devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States.\nAlready, herds of elk, deer, and pronghorn antelope roam the grasslands, where visitors can camp, hike, and bike. Cottonwoods and willows are thriving along streams, creating habitats for bobcats, beavers, and other animals.\nNot everyone shares APF's vision. Some residents of Phillips County (pop. 3,904) worry that the area could become a prairie Disneyland, overcrowded with tourists. But the biggest obstacle is the ranchers themselves, whose cattle compete with prairie dogs and bison for grass and space.\n\"People like me have no intention of selling their ranches,\" says Dale Veseth, who heads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance of 35 families in Phillips County and whose family has been ranching here since 1886. \"They've been a labor of love through the generations.\" Instead, he wants APF to pay or\nranchers to raise...\nQuestion: What measures have been taken to protect the wildlife by APF?\nOptions: A: They have borrowed much money and developed new habitat.\nB: They have hired many farmers to raise bison on their farms.\nC: They have turned grassland into Disneyland to attract tourists.\nD: They have bought large land from farmers for bison to live on.",

Probably the best example is the rush to produce ethanol  for fuel from corn. Corn is a renewable resource --you can harvest it and grow more, almost limitlessly. So replacing gas with corn ethanol seems like a great idea.\nOne might get a bit more energy out of the ethanol than that used to make it, which could still make ethanol more sustainable than gas generally, but that's not the end of the problem. Using corn to make ethanol means less corn is left to feed animals and people, which drives up the cost of food. That result leads to turning the fallow land -including, in some cases, rain forest in places such as Brazil--into farmland, which in turn gives off lots of carbon dioxide (CO) into the air. Finally, over many years, the energy benefit from burning ethanol would make up for the forest loss. But by then, climate change would have progressed so far that _ might not help.\nYou cannot really declare any practice \"sustainable\" until you have done a complete life-cycle analysis of its environmental  costs. Even then, technology and public keep developing, and that development can lead to unforeseen and undesired results. The admirable goal of living sustainably requires plenty of thought on an ongoing basis.\nQuestion: What might directly cause the loss of the forest according to the text?\nOptions: A: The growing demand for energy to make ethanol\nB: The increasing carbon dioxide in the air\nC: The greater need for farmland\nD: The big change in weather.",

The Cuckoo's Calling was the week's bestselling hardback novel, despite some booksellers running out of stock.\nThe Harry Potter author was identified in a newspaper article last week. On a website Rowling said 8,500 English language copies had been sold in all forms, including e-books, before her unmasking.\nThe author added that she had received two offers from television production companies. \"The situation was becoming increasingly complicated, largely because Robert was doing rather better than we had expected him to,\" she said. \"But we all still hoped to keep the secret a little longer.  Robert's success during his first three months as a published writer (discounting sales made after I was found out) actually compares favourably with JK Rowling's success over the similar period of her career.\"\nHowever, the Bookseller reported the hardback had sold fewer than 500 copies in its three-month period on sale before the Sunday Times' expose. The recent sales were not enough to send The Cuckoo's Calling to the top spot in the official UK top 50, instead landing it in third place.\nThe Rowling revelation coincided with the paperback release of The Casual Vacancy -- her first official post-Potter work--which sold 19,548 copies in the same week, making the book number two in the sales chart. Neither title managed to draw John Grisham's The Racketeer from the top of the chart, which shifted 24,222 copies -- a 19% drop on the previous week.\nElsewhere on the Robert Galbraith website, Rowling has revealed the reason she chose her pen name.

And she's not the only one. In the moments before the quake, an orangutan   let out a loud call and then climbed to the top of her shelter.\n\"It's very different from their normal call,\" said Brandie Smith, the zookeeper. \"The lemurs (monkey-like animals of Madagascar) will sound an alarm call if they see or hear something highly unusual.\"\nBut you can't see or hear an earthquake 15 minutes before it happens, can you?

Although it's usually more common in big cities, it can be found in almost any community, big or small.\nThe problem with graffiti art is the question of whether it's really art. This isn't always an easy question to answer, simply because there are so many different types of graffiti. While some simply consists of collections of letters, known as tags, with little artistic value, such examples are easy to find, especially on larger spaces such as walls.\nIf it weren't for the fact that most graffiti is placed on private property without permission, it might be more commonly recognized as a legal form of art. Most graffiti, however, annoys the property owner, who is more likely to paint over it or remove it than accept it as art.\nMany ways of removing graffiti have been developed, such as paints that dissolve graffiti paint, or make it easy to remove. Community groups and government departments often organize graffiti-removal teams.\nIt hardly makes sense to encourage artists to deface   private or public property; but perhaps there are ways to work with them rather than just oppose them. Graffiti artists can, for example, create murals   for property owners, and get paid for them.\nMaybe we need to start at a very basic level, and find a way to encourage the creation of graffiti art on paper or canvas rather than on walls. After all, who would remember Monet or Picasso if they'd created their masterpieces on walls, only to have them painted over the next day?

He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it.\nHe won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the \"behavior\" of molecules  led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the\"building blocks of life\".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell.\nDuring World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948. However,the use of the atomic bomb near the end of the war turned Pauling in a new direction. Having long worked on the structure of molecules,he took an immediate interest in the deadly effects of nuclear fallout on human molecular structures.\nFrom then on,Pauling protested the production of the hydrogen bomb and supported the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons.

A Japanese man died in 1986 at the age of 120 years and 237 days.\nJeanne Calment lives in a small old people's home in the south of France, her husband, her only child and her grandson have all died. She is nearly blind and deaf and is always in a wheelchair, but her doctor describes here as being \"more like a 90-year-old in good health\" than someone of 120. She still has a lively sense of humor. When asked on the 120thbirthday what she expected of the future, she replied, \"A very short one.\" She also remarked that she thought the good Lord had forgotten all about her.\nSo what is the key to a long life? According to some doctors, diet, exercise and no smoking are the three important factors. Jeanne Calment has followed two of the tips. She has always eaten a healthy diet, and she used to do exercises every day until she broke her leg at the age of 115. However, until recently she drank two glasses of strong red wine a say, and she does smoke (now only a little). Besides, Jeanne Calment might have got very good _ from her parents. Her father lived to the age of 94 and her mother to 86.\nA local lawyer bought her house when she was 80 under an agreement that he would pay her some money every year until her death. It must have seemed a good move at the time, but so far the lawyer has paid her at least three times the value of the house.

Do you believe that every cloud has a silver lining and that things generally turn out for the best? Do you believe that if something is meant to be, it will be? If you reply \"yes\" to all of these questions, then you are an optimist. You probably are enthusiastic, cheerful and outgoing. You may be successful at work and in love.\nBut you may be misguided because things don't turn out for the best. You may believe that when one door closes another one opens (for example, you may fail to obtain a new job; another chance will come around soon). Wrong. When one door closes, another door slams   in your face. That's bitter reality.\nNow a book has been published which confirms what pessimists   have suspected all along. It's called The Positive Power of Defensive Pessimism. Its author argues that defensive pessimism can lead to positive results. Defensive pessimism is a strategy used to manage fear, anxiety and worry. Defensive pessimists prepare for the things by setting low outcomes for themselves. They carefully consider everything that may go wrong and plan for ways to handle these problems. And this gives them a sense of control. Lawrence Sanno, a psychology professor, says, \"What's interesting about defensive pessimists is that they tend to be very successful people, so their low opinion of the situation's outcomes is not realistic. They use it to motivate themselves to perform better.\"\nSo far, so good. _ . Defensive pessimists prepare carefully and consider what might go wrong, whether at work, on date or even in a sports game. It makes sense to have a back-up plan.

In this sense, being realistic about potential problems enables people to successfully deal with them if they arise. This suggests that the author views himself as \"a realist\". Moreover, his tone implies he does not value optimism or confidence highly because he believes overconfidence often leads to mistakes (“Confidence is what you have before you understand the problem.\").\nSo C) A realist is correct choice. ### C"

Some parts of the sea are very shallow. But in some places the depth of the sea is very great. There is one spot, near Japan, where the sea is nearly 11 kilometers deep! The highest mountain in the world is about 9 kilometers high. If that mountain were put into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it!\nThe sea is salty.

Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have it, look at themold ( ) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of tough trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently than they score.\n     The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal--and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.\n     \"Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there's no particular goodness in doing things the way they have always been done.\" Wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language authority. This accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: \"How come nobody thought of that before?\"\n     The creative approach begins with the proposal that nothing be as it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route.

The district will then assess how well the schools perform, and three winners will copy those designs in 50 to 70 new buildings.\nGreen schools are appearing all over, but in Clark County,which stands out for its vastness, such aggressive targets are difficult because design requirements like more natural light for students go against the realities of a desert climate. \"One of the biggest challenges is getting the right site orientation  ,\" Mark McGinty, a director at SH Architecture, says.

The amount of these chemicals has risen heavily in the past few years, as more areas of the world industrialize and new products are produced. Over 80,000 different chemicals are used in industries world wide. Around the world hundreds of millions of tons of harmful waste are produced each year. Often, it is difficult and expensive to get rid of these chemicals or to store them in a way that does not endanger human life and the environment.\n     Every year, major health problems result from harmful waste. Sadly, it is often when someone has died or, become seriously ill that governments will take action and reduce levels of dumped harmful waste. In 1989, a school inprefix = st1 /New Jerseyhad to be closed because students there had suffered too much exposure to chromium. It was later learned that large amounts of chromium had been dumped nearby and blown over to the school area.\n     Research has been done to provide information on the effects of every chemical. Because waste chemicals often mix together, it will also be necessary to learn how the combinations of these chemicals affect human health.\n   Some governments have realized how serous the problem is and are making laws to get rid of harmful waste. They are also trying to limit the amount of waste industries are allowed to produce.\n   Not only governments but the public as well must form part of the solution. They can choose not to buy those products which require the production of harmful waste, attempt to affect policymakers, and produce less harmful waste themselves.

She paid two long visits during the last five years of the eighteenth century and from 1801 to 1806, Bath was her home.

They not only hide the real face of the mask wearer but they often evoke powerful emotions in the audience--danger, fear, sadness, joy. You might think, because so many things vary cross-culturally, that the ways in which emotions are displayed and recognized in the face vary too. Apparently they do not. Recent research on masks from different cultures supports the conclusion that masks, like faces, tend to represent certain emotions in the same ways. We now have some evidence that the symbolism used in masks is often universal.\nThe research on masks builds on work done by anthropologists, who used photographs of individuals experiencing various emotions. These photographs were shown to members of different cultural groups who were asked to identify the emotions displayed in the photographs. Emotions were identified correctly by most viewers, whatever the viewer's native culture.\nCoding schemes were developed to enable researchers to compare the detailed facial positions of individual portions of die face (eyebrows, mouth, etc.) for different emotions. What exactly do we do when we scowl? We contract the eyebrows and lower the corners of the mouth; in geometric terms, we make angles and diagonals   on our faces. When we smile, we raise the corners of the mouth; we make it curved.\nPsychologist Joel Arnoff and his colleagues compared two types of wooden face masks from many different societies--masks described as threatening versus masks associated with nonthreatening functions. As suspected, the two sets of masks had significant differences in certain facial elements. The threatening masks had eyebrows and eyes facing inward and downward and a downward-facing mouth. In more abstract or geometrical terms, threatening features generally tend to be angular or diagonal and nonthreatening features tend to be curved or rounded, a face with a pointed beard is threatening; _ is not. The theory is that humans express and recognize basic emotions in uniform  ...\nQuestion: What does the passage mainly discuss?\nOptions: A: The techniques for comparing facial expressions across cultures.\nB: The photography of faces.\nC: Cultural variations in mask.\nD: The uniformity of facial expressions in revealing emotions.",

He was content with very simple forms of shelter, made his own rough tools and weapons and could provide food and clothing for himself and his family from natural materials around him. As he became more civilized, however, he began to want better shelter, more efficient tools and weapons, and more comfortable and more lasting clothing than could be provided by his own neighborhood or by the work of his own unskilled hands. For these things he had to turn to the skilled people such as smiths, leather workers or carpenters. It was then that the question of payment arose.\nAt first he got what he wanted by a simple process of exchange. The smith who had not the time to look after land or cattle was glad to take meat or grain from the farmer in exchange for an axe or a plough  . But as more and more goods which had no fixed exchange value came on the market, exchange became too complicated to be satisfactory. Another problem arose when those who made things wanted to get stocks of wood or leather, or iron, but had nothing to offer in exchange until their finished goods were ready.\nThus the difficulties of exchange led by degree to the invention of money. In some countries easily handled things like seeds or shells were given a certain value and farmer, instead of paying the smith for a new axe by giving him some meat or grain, gave him so many shells. If the smith had any shells left when he had bought his food, he could get stocks of the raw materials of his trade. In some countries quite large things such as cows or camels or even big flat stones were used for trade. Later, pieces of metal, bearing values according to the rarity   of the metal and the size of the pieces, or coins were used. Money as we know it had arrived.\nQuestion: As men became more civilized they   _  .\nOptions: A: all learnt to make by themselves the things needed\nB: had to travel a lot to look for what they wanted\nC: wanted better things than those they themselves could provide\nD: no longer provided food and clothing for themselves",

But she had no birth certificate or passport when she arrived on an immigrant ship from Ireland from Ireland with her parents, who had 12 other children.\nShe never gave the matter much thought until 1999, when she was in her late 70s and needed assistance to raise her grandchildren. For 12 years, Mrs. Stout managed to support the family by doing various jobs. But her life was hard and marked by tragedy. Her husband died in 1996, and her son Thomas died in a car accident with his girlfriend in 1985. Her only surviving child, Rosemary, died of cancer in 2009.\nA Catholic charity referred her case to Chicago Irish Immigrant Support(CIIS), which alerted the Irish Consulate . Through them, they tracked down her birth certificate, the website irishcentral.com reported. The document, in turn, allowed her to receive her Irish passport, and eventually her American green card in September 2011, which was dated back to November 1, 1923.\nQuestion: What will happen to a person if he has no green card in the US?\nOptions: A: he cannot get any chance to get education\nB: he can't have a pension and other benefits\nC: his citizenship will be taken away\nD: he has to take illegal part-time job",

With regard to helping those in difficulty generally, they found that:\n(1) women are helped more than men;\n(2) men help more than women;\n(3) attractive women are helped more than unattractive women.\nOther factors relate to the number of people in the area, whether the person is thought to be in trouble through their own fault, and whether a person sees himself as being able to help.\nAccording to Adrian Furnham, Professor of University College, London, there are three reasons why we tend to stand by doing nothing:\n(1) \"Shifting of responsibility\"-the more people there are, the less likely help is to be given. Each person excuses himself by thinking someone else will help, so that the more \"other people' there are, the greater the total shifting of responsibility.\n(2) \"'Fear of making a mistake''-situations are often not clear. People think that those involved in an accident may know each other or it may be a joke, so a fear of embarrassment makes them keep themselves to themselves.\n(3) \"Fear of the consequences if attention is turned on you, and the person is violent.\"\nLaurie Taylor, Professor of Sociology at London University, says: \"In the experiments I've seen on intervention  , much depends on the neighborhood or setting. There is a silence on public transport which is hard to break.

I'm pleasantly surprised.\nThe promising Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan.Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper,  it doesn't _ itself immediately,  and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering ( ), so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter ,for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration.The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass,  supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead.\nFor days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist.

What do birds have to do with high speed trains?\nThese may sound like strange things to put together. But scientists, inventors, and designers are doing just that. They are learning from nature to create new technology.\nThe word biomimicry   combines two words: biology and mimicry. So people using biomimicry try to use examples in nature to design new technology.\nBiomimicry is not a new idea. People have been studying nature for hundreds of years. Leonardo DaVinci used birds as models to invent his flying machine. And when the Wright Brothers made the first successful airplane, they also studied birds. In 998, Janine Benyus, a natural science writer and teacher, wrote a book about biomimicry. To develop her interest in the subject, Janine Benyus started the Biomimicry Institute.\nThe Biomimicry Institute is a non-profit organization. It brings together scientists, designers, inventors and many other people. It offers classes to teach people biomimicry. It provides money for people to research and test new technologies. And it wants all people, from children to adults, to think about new ways to learn from nature.\nPeople involved with the Biomimicry Institute believe that biomimicry can help solve many of the world's problems. Often, new technologies can harm nature, but this is not true for biomimicry. Let's look at some examples.\nButterflies have colorful wings because light shines off them in a special way. Scientists want to copy these same ways to make light shine off computers. They hope this will make for more colorful screens.\nAnother example of biomimicry is the bullet train. It travels at speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour! But it had a problem: it made too much noise!\nThrough the observation of birds, scientists thought about a kind of bird, the kingfisher . The kingfisher can dive into water without making any noise because of the shape of its beak . Researchers thought that if they could design the front of the train like this beak, the...\nQuestion: What's the main idea of the text?\nOptions: A: Biomimicry is widely used in the world.\nB: People copy nature to create new technologies.\nC: The Biomimicry Institute was set up for science.\nD: Birds play an important part in new technologies.",

But the truth is that some of them have instincts, and besides this, I am sure they can feel certain things we humans cannot. A personal experience showed me this.\nSome years ago, I had a dog named Howard. From the time when he was a puppy, he was timid, so we named him Howard, sounding like \"coward\"! He was especially afraid of thunderstorms. At the first flash of lightning or crash of thunder, he would run whining into his house and hide under a table.\nI often went for a walk with Howard. Once, as we were walking along a road, it began to rain. I quickly ran to a bus stop for shelter. The bus stop had a roof supported by metal poles. Soon after I had got there, Howard caught my trousers in his teeth and tried to pull me away. At first I was puzzled and a little angry at his behavior. But I decided to humor him and walked away from the shelter into the rain and started to go home.\nWhen I was about two hundred metres from the shelter, there came a flash of lightning and soon after, there was thunder which nearly deafened me. Howard stopped walking and began whining. Thinking he was afraid, I bent to pick him up. As I straightened up, I glanced at the bus shelter we had just left. I was shocked to see that two of the poles were bent and the roof was lying on the ground, broken. The shelter had been struck by the bolt of lightning!\nQuestion: The reason why the author was puzzled and angry with the dog was that  _  .\nOptions: A: Howard had a strange behavior\nB: Howard should be afraid of the metal poles\nC: Howard should know the approaching of the terrible lightning\nD: Howard bit his trousers in his teeth",

Researchers have unearthed  tiny bones that they believe belong to an entire new human species. If that's true, it will change how we think about our ancestors.\nClues that the little people may have lived long ago were first revealed last year in the scientific journal Nature. Scientists said that they had found the bones of a three-foot-tall female on the island of Flores, in Indonesia. When they looked more closely, they saw that the nearly complete skeleton  belonged to a full-grown adult. Researchers named her Hobbit, after the tiny heroes of the Lord of the Rings books.\nNow the team is saying it has unearthed even more pieces of the puzzle, including a jawbone and parts of arms, legs and hands from several individuals, as well as stone tools. They reported their find in Nature this month. \"The new evidence makes it very clear that these people are a new species, distinct from modern humans,\" Peter Brown, a scientist on the team, said. They named these ancient humans Homo floresiensis.\nBrown says that these little people lived as recently as 12,000 years ago. If Homo floresiensis was a different species from modern humans, that would make our family tree bigger than we knew. It means, says Brown, that \"until recently, a   shared the planet with us.\"\nMany scientists think a new species is unlikely. Some argue that the bones must have belonged to modern humans whose small size was the result of a genetic problem.\nDaniel E. Lieberman, a scientist at Harvard University, thinks that the debate over the discovery is healthy.

That's enough for Dave. He went mostly because it was a social event with a few friends, not so much to catch fish. Even driving up a twisty two-lane road was worth the trip. Let alone the big, beautiful houses and trees that lined the shore of the lake.\nPreparing was a project in itself. Dace had even created a computer file named Fishing Trip. It was a checklist of 45 things to take to Big Bear. He took two rods, because on Free Fishing Day you were allowed to fish with two rods instead of the usual one rod. He took a sweatshirt, jeans, two pairs of socks, a heavy hooded jacket, winter gloves, and a scarf. He also took flip-flops, shorts, a T-shirt, sunglasses, a big hat, and lightweight raincoat. If you go to Big Bear in June, you'd better be prepared for hot or cold, rain or shine.\nHe prepared a couple of magazines to read just in case the fish weren't biting.

A Japanese scientist recorded one bamboo plant that grew almost 1.5 meters in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe. There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains.\nNot all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide _ . This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green.\nMany Asian countries have been using bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for building new buildings. As a matter of fact, the cables  that hold up the hanging bridge across the Min River in Sichuan are made of bamboo. The bridge has been in use for more than 1,000 years, and is still holding strong.\nIn Africa, engineers are teaching poor farmers how to find water using bamboo.

Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.\nWhen Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.\nLee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances. Her first album titled \"Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers\" was released in June, 2008.\nLee speaks highly of her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, \"As time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend.\"\nQuestion: Which of the following can best describe Sun?\nOptions: A: stubborn and devoted\nB: impatient and strict\nC: enthusiastic and hardworking\nD: honest and responsible",

In addition, this also indicates that she might be enthusiastic as well since she seemed very excited about bringing out the talents within her daughter from such a young age.

He was reaching the high school age, but his hometown offered no high school for blacks.\nFortunately he had a strong-willed   caring mother. John remembered that his mother told him many times, \"Son, you can be anything you want really to be if you just believe.\"She told him not to depend on others, including his mother. \"You have to earn success, \"she said. \"All the people who work hard don't succeed, but the only people who do succeed are those who work hard.\"\nThese words came from a woman with less than a third grade education. She also knew that believing and hard work don't mean everything. So she worked hard as a cook for two years to save enough to take her son, who was then 15, to Chicago.\nChicago in 1933 was not the promised land that black southerners were looking for. John's mother and stepfather could not find work. But here John could go to school, and here he learned the power of words--as an editor of the newspaper and yearbook at Du Sable High School His wish was to publish a magazine for blacks.\nWhile others discouraged him, John's mother offered him more words to live by.\"Nothing beats a failure but a try. \"She also let him pawn her furniture to get the $ 500 he needed to start the Negro magazine.\nIt is natural that difficulties and failures followed John closely until he became very successful.

Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective.\nResearcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the\nof more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.\nAmong the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?'  The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades.\n\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\" said Bao. \"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\"\nBao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death.  A serving size is 28 grams.\nNuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart.\nBao says researchers are planning studies to find out how nuts are beneficial to human health.\nThe study on the health benefits of nuts was funded by the International Tree Nut Council Research and Education Foundation.\nQuestion: People who often eat nuts    _   .\nOptions: A: are more likely to live longer than people who often eat fruits\nB: don't need to go to hospital\nC: may live longer than people who don't eat nuts\nD: don't have to do sports",

A city was to be built at sea, housing 30,000 people.\nThe suggestion was to shape the city like a harbor .The outer wall of the harbor would stand on steel columns resting on the sea-bed. Naturally this could only be where the water was fairly shallow. The people would like to live in flats in the fifty-metre high outer wall. The flats would be all face inwards, and would be made of concrete  and glass. The glass would be specially made and colored to control the heat and strong light from the sun. The planners called this man-made harbor would be calm. On it would be floating islands carrying more building: a hospital, two theaters, museum, an art exhibition hall and a church. On one of the islands would be a special factory to take the salt out of sea water and turn it into fresh water.\nPeople living in the city could move around on small boats driven by electricity, so there would be no air pollution from the burning of gas. There would be platforms outside the man wall for ships bringing supplies.

The system can manipulate, or in other word, control your emotions and personal preferences by presenting you with an image of your own smiling or frowning face.\nThe principle that physiological changes can drive emotional ones - that laughter comes before happiness, rather than the other way around - is a well-established idea.\nThe researchers wanted to see if this idea could be used to build a computer system that manipulates how you feel. The system works by presenting the user with a web-camera image of his or her face - as if they were looking in a mirror. The image is then subtly altered with software, turning the corners of the mouth up or down and changing the area around the eyes, so that the person appears to smile or frown  .\nWithout telling them the aim of the study, the team recruited   21 volunteers and asked them to sit in front of the screen while performing an unrelated task.

And I think 'American' cuisine is moving in the same direction, becoming more localized, not globalized. \"\nAmerican cuisine is shaped by the natural wealth of the country. Having never faced agricultural hardship, Americans don't have to rely on rotating crops, such as the Japanese, whose food culture now showcases buckwheat   alongside rice, or the Indians, or the French and Italians, who feature beans alongside wheat. \"That kind of negotiation with the land forced people to incorporate  those crops in to the culture,\" says Barber. And so eating soba noodles becomes part of what it means to be Japanese, and eating beans becomes part of what it means to be French.\nSo if what we eat is what we are, what are Americans? Well, meat. \"If Americans have any unifying food identity, I would say we are a mostly white meat culture,\" says Barber. \"The protein-centric dinner plate, whether you're talking about a boneless chicken breast, or a 16-ounce steak, as an everyday expectation is something that America really created, and now exports to the rest of the world.\"\nEvery single culture and religion uses food as part of their celebrations, says Ellen Gustafson, co-founder of the FEED Project and The 30 Project, which aims to deal with both hunger and overweight issues globally. \"The celebratory nature of food is universal. Every season, every harvest, and every holiday has its own food, and this is true in America as well. It helps define us.\"\nQuestion: What has made American cuisine different from other cuisines according to the article?\nOptions: A: Relying on rotating crops\nB: The difficulty of planting crops\nC: The US' melting pot culture\nD: The US' agricultural wealth",

        "output": "In the article, Barber notes that in other countries, people have to create new dishes out of necessity. For example, some Chinese communities began eating buckwheat as a supplement for rice when they were unable to grow it because their soil lacked nitrogen. The Indians would also eat beans and peas with wheat as part of an alternative grain diet due to crop rotation between crops like maize or millet.\nHowever, American cuisine is shaped by America's natural wealth so Americans do not need alternate grains or ingredients since they can afford enough food without them.

At the point thetrains turned their freight, mail, and passengers over to steamboats, wagons, and stagecoaches. This meant that wagon freighting, stage coaching, and steam boating did not come to an end when the first train appeared; rather they became supplements or feeders. Each new \"end of track\" became a center for animal drawn or waterborne transportation. The major effect of the railroad was to shorten the distance that had to be covered by the older, slower, and more costly means. Wagon freighters continued operating throughout the 1870's and 1880's and into the 1890's. Although over constantly shrinking routes, and coaches and wagons continued to crisscross the West wherever the rails had not yet been laid. The beginning of a major change was foreshadowed in the later 1860's, when the Union Pacific Railroad at last began to build westward from the Central Plains city of Omaha to meet the Central Pacific Railroad advancing eastward from California through the formidable barrier of the Sierra Nevada. Although President Abraham Lincoln signed the original Pacific Railroad bill in 1862 and a revised, financially much more generous version in 1864, little construction was completed until 1865 on the Central Pacific and 1866 on the Union Pacific. The primary reason was skepticism that a Railroad built through so challenging and thinly settled a stretch of desert, mountain, and semiarid plain could pay a profit. In the words of an economist, this was a case of \"premature enterprise\", where not only the cost of construction but also the very high risk deterred private investment. In discussing the Pacific Railroad bill, the chair of the congressional committee bluntly stated that without government subsidy no one would undertake so unpromising a venture; yet it was a national necessity to link East and West together.\nQuestion: The word \"subsidy\" in line 27 is closest in meaning to  _  .\nOptions: A: persuasion\nB: financing\nC: explanation\nD: penalty",

Yes, this story is about the Taj Mahal, one of the most famous buildings in the world. And the tale behind the construction is just as impressive   as the building itself.\nFirst, there's the emperor of northern India, Shah Jehan, also called the King of the World. In 1612, Shah Jehan married Mumtaz Mahal. Mad in love, they had 14 children over the next 20 years. But then sadness came. As Mumtaz was about to give birth to child number 14, she said she heard her unborn baby cry out. It was a sign of death. And as Mumtaz lay dying, she asked Jehan to build a lasting memorial   to celebrate their love.\nThe heartbroken Jehan ordered his wife's dying wish carried out, and more than 20,000 workers worked nearly 22 years to complete the construction. In 1653, Jehan placed Mumtaz's remains under the center of the building.\nLater, son number five, Aurangzeb, murdered his brothers and took over the power from his aging father. Jehan lived the rest of his days, eight years, imprisoned not far from the Taj Mahal. Jehan was only allowed to climb onto the top of his prison to see the timeless treasure from a distance. But never again would he be allowed to visit it until he was buried next to his wife.\nToday 25,000 people visit the Taj Mahal each day.

However, a group of senior Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park were recently faced with noise complaints from nearby residents. The local court even served a summons   related to a certain Ms. Wang.\nThe news soon caused heated discussion across China, with many believing the incident to involve a cultural conflict between the East and West,while others view it as a form of discrimination against Chinese in the United States.\nThe United States is a diverse society, and in many cases, Chinese dancers are tolerated and even appreciated. Meanwhile, the United States is a society based on the rule of law, and due to cultural differences, local regulations seem to be very different from those in China. As a result, some old Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park found themselves caught in an embarrassing situation. Locals and immigrants from other nations view such noise as a violation of their right to enjoy _ . Calling the police is regarded as the most efficient way to solve such a problem.\nBefore, these ladies probably did not understand local customs and rules. However, since the incident took place, they should perhaps know a little better next time and keep the noise to a minimum.

In the 1940's it was a wholesome, specific little community. It was my home and I loved it there; back then I thought I would never leave. My best friend Rose and I used to collectively dream about raising a family of our own someday. We had it all planned out to live next door to one another.\nOur dream remained alive through grade school, high school, and even beyond. Rose was my maid of honor when I got married in 1953 to the love of my life, Dick. Even then she joked that she was just one perfect guy short of being married, thus bringing us closer to our dream. Meanwhile, Dick aspired to be an officer in the Marines and I fully supported his ambitions. I realized that he might be stationed far away from Jamaica Plain, but I told him I would relocate and adjust. The idea of experiencing new places together seemed somewhat romantic to me.\nSo, in 1955, Dick was stationed in Alaska and we relocated. Rose was sad to see me leave, but wished me the best of luck. Rose and I remained in touch for a few years by regular phone call but after a while we lost track of one another.

Every person perceives himself to have a sort of invisible shield surrounding his physical body. When someone comes too close, he feels uncomfortable. When he bumps onto someone, he feels obligated to apologize. But the size of a person's \"comfort zone\" depends on his cultural ethnic origin. For example, in casual conversation, many Americans stand about four feet apart. In other words, they like to keep each other \"at arm's length\", people in Latin or Arab cultures, in contrast, stand very close to each other, and touch each other often. If someone from one of those cultures stands too close to an American while in conversation, the American may feel uncomfortable and back away.\nWhen Americans are talking, they expect others to respond to what they are saying. To Americans, polite conversationalists empathize by displaying expressions of excitement or disgust, shock or sadness. People with a \"poker face\", whose emotions are hidden by a deadpan expression, are looked upon with suspicion. Americans also indicate their attentiveness in a conversation by raising their eyebrows, nodding, smiling politely and maintaining good eye contact. Whereas some cultures view direct eye contact as impolite or threatening, Americans see it as a sign of genuineness and honesty. If a person doesn't look you in the eye, American might say, you should question his motives--or assume that he doesn't like you. Yet with all the concern for eye contact, Americans still consider staring--especially at strangers--to be rude.\nQuestion: What the author discussed in the previous section is most probably about   _  .\nOptions: A: classification of nonverbal communication\nB: the reasons why people should think about space\nC: the relationship between communication and space\nD: some other cultural aspects of nonverbal communication",

As we age it becomes harder to keep our muscles healthy. They get smaller, which reduces strength and increases the possibility of falls and fractures  . New research is showing how this happens and what to do about it.\nA team of Nottingham researchers has already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age.\nWhen older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin   fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown.\nThe research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. \"We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone  to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,\" Professor Rennie said.\n\" The results were clear.

A British scientist Alec Jeffrey came across DNA fingerprinting: He identified the patterns of genetic material that are unique to almost every individual. His discovery changed everything from the way we do criminal investigations to the way we decide family law. But the professor of genetics at the University of Leicester, UK, is still surprised, and a bit worried, by the power of the technology he released upon the world.\nThe patterns within DNA are unique to each individual, except identical twins, who share the same pattern. The ability to identify these patterns has been used to convict(...) murderers and to clear people who are wrongly accused. It is also used to identify the victims of war and settle disputes over who is the father of a child.\nJeffrey said he and his colleagues made the discovery by accident while tracking genetic variations . But, within six months of the discovery, genetic fingerprinting had been used in an immigration case, to prove that an African boy really was his parents' son.*In 1986, it was used for the first time in a British criminal case: It cleared one suspect after being accused of two murders and helped convict another man.\nDNA testing is now very common. In Britain, a national criminal database established in 1995 now contains 2.5 million DNA samples. The U.S. and Canada are developing similar systems. But there are fears about the stored DNA samples and how they could be used to harm a person's privacy. That includes a person's medical history, racial origin or psychological profile. \"There is the long-term risk that people can get into these samples and start getting additional information about a person's paternity  or risk of disease,\" Jeffrey said.\nDNA testing is not an unfailing proof of identity. Still, it is considered a reasonably reliable system for determining the things it is used for.

Smokers who quit tend to pack on an average of 5 pounds after they stop smoking cigarettes. A new study, published by the journal Science, explains why this happens.\n              The new research explains that nicotine appears to combine with appetite-regulating neurons   in the brain, besides the receptors    that bring about addiction. These neurons help regulate how much food gets consumed, but under the influence of nicotine, they lose their self-control. This is why when smokers quit, they tend to eat more and gain weight.\n              The researchers believe that their discovery will lead to the development of drugs that aim at nicotine receptors on brain cells that control appetite. In the future, weight gain may no longer be a reason for smokers to delay the decision to kick the habit, but that's no reason to wait. Nicotine-replacement treatment, while not for everyone, can help. Here are a few more ways to quit smoking and stay slim.\n              Drink water. To improve metabolic   rates, make half of those glasses ice water. Juice can be too high in calories, something you'll want to keep an eye on your journey toward being a slimmer non-smoker.

Increasingly, employers are looking for individuals who are not only competent and intelligent, but who have different skill sets and who are knowledgeable in many areas. Part of the appeal to employers is that your extra work demonstrates a willingness to take on difficult tasks. Additionally, if your majors overlap  , you are able to show potential employers that you have both _ and depth of knowledge.\nBy studying for a double major, although you will be studying for only one degree, you will be focusing on two related and integrated subjects that complement   each other. Classes overlap between the majors, meaning fewer classes are required than with a double degree, so it is easier to finish within four years.\nIn contrast, with the more rigorous   double degree, you will be studying for two different degrees in two completely different areas of study. Although pursuing such a course    of study allows students to complete two wholly separate degrees in less time than if they  were to earn them separately, many strong students still find it incredibly difficult to complete in four or five years.\nIf you are committed to a double major/degree, it is wise to do a little bit of planning. Some students try to find two courses of studies that are related, while others seek to round out their academic studies by choosing two completely unrelated fields.\nFor double majors, common pairings include: (i) economics and a foreign language; (ii) political science or government and journalism; (iii) economics and psychology.\nFor double degrees, common pairings include: (i) engineering and a business program such as finance or accounting; (ii) engineering and economics.\nQuestion: If you are devoted to a double major or degree, you should   _  .\nOptions: A: find two subjects with overlapping classes\nB: learn about what your potential employers want\nC: decide what to learn with your intentions considered\nD: try to decide on some common pairings as soon as possible",

Such findings tell a powerful story. The obesity epidemic began in the 1980s, and many people think it results from increased portion  sizes and inactivity , but that can't be everything. Big Macs and TVs have been with us for a long time. \"Most experts agree that the changes were related to something in the environment,\" says Thomas Glass of the Hopkins School of Public Health. That something could be a shrinking of the green.\nThe new research, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, isn't the first to associate greenery with better health, but it does get us closer to identifying what works and why. At its most straightforward, a green neighborhood simply means more places for kids to play -- which is important since time spent outdoors is one of the strongest links to children's activity levels.\nGlass warns that most studies don't necessarily prove a link between greenness and health, but they're helping _ action. In September the U.S. government approved the No Child Left Inside Act to encourage public initiatives  aimed at exposing kids to the outdoors.\nFinding green space is, of course, not always easy, and you may have to work a bit to get your family a little grass and trees.

As I stood there soaking in the early morning light, I was reminded of an important lesson.\nWhen I arrived in San Francisco, I told myself, \"Just take photos as you do other things.\" My primary goal was to meet with friends and so I figured I could take pictures as we walked around the city. This resulted in exactly zero photos worth sharing. I had vague ideas like, \"I'd like to do some street photography,\" but I never went out with the intent of photographing something specific. Finally, on the last morning, I went out with the intent of capturing a specific picture and I ended up with something worth sharing.

Air-conditioning began to spread in industries as a production aid during World War II. Today most Americans need to take air-conditioning for granted to homes, offices, factories, theatres, shops, studios, schools, hotels, and restaurants, and we can see it almost everywhere in today's America.\nBut not everybody is aware that high cost and easy comfort are merely two of the effects of the vast cooling of American. In fact, air conditioning has substantially altered the country's character and customs.\nMany of the byproducts are so conspicuous  that they are scarcely noticed. To begin with, air-conditioning transformed the face of America by making possible those glassy, boxy, sealed-in skyscrapers. It has been indispensable, no less, to the functioning of sensitive advanced computers, whose high operating temperatures require that they be constantly cooled. . .\nIt has, at will, forced families into going back into families with closed doors and shut windows to improve the effects of the air-conditioning, reducing the interactions of neighborhood life. I think there is no need explaining the seriousness of this consequence . It is really surprising that the public's often noted withdrawal into self-pursuit and privacy has kept in pace with the historic spread of air-conditioning. Though science has little studied how habitual air-conditioning affects mind and body, some medical experts suggest that, like other technical avoidance of natural changes in climate, air-conditioning may damage the human capacity to adapt to stress. If so, air-conditioning is only like many other greatly useful technical developments that liberate  man from nature by increasing his productivity and power in some way - while indirectly weakening him in others.\nQuestion: The tone of this passage reveals that air-conditioning   _  .\nOptions: A: has little effect on its users\nB: has more effect on body than on mind\nC: brings only damage to its users\nD: does harm as well as good to its users",

The British and American editions were No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the sales chart of the Beijing Xidan Book Building last week. The book's poster is highlighted and news about the book can often be heard on the radio.\nWhy is the book so attractive to children? With curious mood, the author got a copy of \"Harry Potter\". Originally, I wanted to glance over it and made some criticisms. But, out of expectation, the author has been deeply attracted by the magic world. On the other hand, one cannot help asking:  _ Harry Potter\"?\nThe Chinese nation has a history of 5, 000 years, which cannot be regarded as short and its culture as not profound. With a vast market of youngsters, China did publish many books popular among children. However, why are the present works not as good as those imported?\nThere come two major reasons: Firstly, quite a number of children's books are of strong sense of teaching, and lack interest and entertainment. Children often have a feeling of being \"educated\". No wonder they don't like them. Secondly, children's reading materials involving \"idiom stories\" and \"Chinese talents' stories\", though always in different covers, are usually much the same or plagiarized . One knows the ending as early as in the beginning. In final analysis, the authors of the books seldom take children's requirements into consideration.\nAs a matter of fact, each child has his own wonderful imagination. They long to understand the world and nature. Similarly they have their own choices. They dislike similar stories, even if the stories are excellent. First-class reading for children should be very interesting, which contains knowledge and the essence  of national culture, which are presented in children's language.\nMarket is a touchstone for products. The theory also holds true for cultural products. It is hoped that the authors of children's books can learn something from the good market of \"Harry Potter\" and write out...\nQuestion: The reason why the imported book is so popular is that   _  .\nOptions: A: it has no sense of teaching\nB: it opens a wonderful world for children to explore\nC: it is only written in children's language\nD: it is advertised more on TV or poster.",

If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our sky-high divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.\nWe tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses. By 1932, when nearly one-quarter of the work force was unemployed, it had declined by around 25 percent from 1929. But this does not mean that people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes plummeting and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared that neither would be able to manage alone.\nToday, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households. Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes. \nAfter financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities. A 1940 book, \"The Unemployed Man and His Family,\" described a family in which the husband first reacted to losing his job \"with tireless search for work.\" He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do.\nThe problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain (continue). For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually defeated their attempts to keep their families together. The rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold.\nMillions of American families may now be in the initial (earliest) stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment.\n Today's economic depression could well generate a similar backlog  of couples whose relationships have been irreparably ruined.

High school was hard, because everyone wanted to have nice clothes, hang out, drive cars, and all these cost money. Peter's father was the sort of guy that believed you had to earn whatever you got, so he wasn't just about to hand over lots of money for Peter to use to have fun. So, he had to get a job.\nDuring his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay   farm. He threw hay up into wagons as the tractor drove around fields, and then they stacked   it in the hot barn. It was a hot, lowpaying job.\nHe once worked a few nights a week at a grocery store. He put things on the shelf. It was a lot of lifting and carrying, and his arms were strong from this and the previous job. It was dull and didn't pay much.\nHe took some time off when soccer got serious, but the following summer he tried working at a lumber yard. It was hot outside, but he got a lot of exercise lifting and carrying things like boards and drywall. He also learned a lot about building supplies. It still didn't pay well.\nFrom there, he spent a year doing some tutoring for a friend of the family, but that was piecemeal. His first real job came the last year at school, when he fixed registers and worked on computers at a big box store. It was his favorite job yet, but it still didn't pay well.\nWhat Peter realized with all of these jobs was that he needed a better paying job! The only way to get that was to get trained or educated. He could go to school and get a 2year degree in an office or technical position. His other choices were going to a 4year college or joining the army. He wasn't sure what he was going to do yet, but he knew he had to do something. Jobs were a lot of work, money was hard to earn, but he liked staying busy and being able to buy things. Peter wanted the most out of life, and that meant education.\nQuestion: All the jobs Peter had taken had one thing in common:  _  .\nOptions: A: They were done during his vacation\nB: They were dull and tiresome\nC: They needed hard labour\nD: They didn't pay well",

The phrase \"It still didn't pay well\" is repeated throughout the article to emphasize that all of these jobs did not have high salaries. Moreover, by saying he wanted more out of life and describing education as being important for getting better paying positions, it can be inferred that Peter found difficulty earning money from low-paying work.\nBased on this context, D: They didn’t pay well would be the most likely answer because it describes something common between all of the jobs mentioned by Peter - they were paid poorly (unlike A: They were done during his vacations). ### D"

Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer.\"\nThe young student was experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the great nervousness. though poor scores are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety causes low scores. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students.\nSpecial university counseling  courses try to help students. In these courses, counselors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the test shows their anxiety is high, the students can take courses to help them deal with their nervousness. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease, learn information, then come out without difficulty in a test.\nAn expert at the University of California explains, \"With almost all students, relaxation is felt after taking our program. Most of them have better control during their test. Almost all have some improvements.

Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, the green turtle was listed as threatened except for the breeding populations in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, where it is listed as endangered.\nGreen turtles continue to be caught for money by humans, and the destruction and loss of nesting and foraging sites is a serious problem. Humans have already caused the decrease of large green turtle populations, including those that once nested in Bermuda and Cayman Islands. The situation of green turtle populations is difficult to determine because of our lack of knowledge about their life cycles. The number of nests in Florida appears to be increasing, but we don't know whether this is due to an increase in the number of nests or because we have started to monitor nesting beaches more closely.\nThe green turtle is the largest hardshelled sea turtle. Adults of this species commonly reach 100 cm in length and 150 kg in mass. The average size of a female nesting in Florida is 101.5 cm straight in length, with an average body mass of 136 kg.\nGrowth rates of green turtles have not been measured under natural conditions. Green turtles grow slowly.\nIn the southern Bahamas, green turtles grow from 30 to 75 cm in 17 years, and according to Bjorndal and Bolten, growth rates decrease with increasing length. Growth rates measured in green turtles from Florida and Puerto Rico fall within the range of growth rates measured in the southern Bahamas. Based on growth rate studies of wild green turtles, the researchers Balazs, Frazer and Ehrhart estimate the age of sexual maturity can range anywhere from 20 to 50 years.\nQuestion: The main idea of the passage is to tell us   _   .\nOptions: A: something about an endangered animal\nB: how green turtles got extinct\nC: how heavy a green turtle is\nD: how long a green turtle can live",

We all know of damage that anger has caused us. There are many old stories that tell us the bad effects of anger. \n    But the question is whether we should never experience anger and lead lives like sages  ?I do not think the answer is a firm yes. Everyone should have this emotion and be able to use it in a wise way. In other words, it is also known as controlled aggression. We see a lot of this kind of controlled emotion when we watch athletes in action. If an athlete has the right amount of aggression, the game or the battle is half won. The other half can be won by his skills.\n     Controlled aggression or anger also plays an important role in a person's career and life. During the courses of a person's career, people who hold high positions need to exercise this emotion called anger in a professional and right manner. For getting the work done well, it is important for you to make use of positive aggression or controlled anger. We can extend this to our daily lives as well. If the parent is not strict at times, children will behave in a wrong way and do not develop as they are expected. Teachers have to exercise this emotion in a wise way to make the students gain knowledge in an effective manner.\n     All in all, if one is able to use the emotion called anger in a controlled manner, it will lead to the smooth development in his life and career.\nQuestion: We can infer that if a teacher uses controlled anger,   _  .\nOptions: A: his students may get good grades\nB: he will often get angry with his students\nC: he will care about his students very much\nD: he will be especially strict with his students",

Earlier in the poem, Keats says that he hopes this 'Love' will be a 'high romance' with a 'fair creature.' He also says that he hopes the 'Fame' he seeks will be the result of the 'high piled books' produced by his 'crowded brain.' In other words, Keats's fear is that death is a 'nothingness' that will arrive before he can finish his life's work or find his true love.\nDonne has a different attitude toward death, and so the imagery in his poem is different, too.To Donne, death should 'be not proud,' because it is not 'mighty and dreadful.' Unlike Keats, Donne sees death as weak and merely a 'slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men.' He also says that death is like 'rest and sleep'.Donne believes that we will all wake from the sleep of death to everlasting life, just as we wake from our normal sleep to our everyday lives.In fact, Donne believes that it is death itself that will die: 'One short sleep past, we wake forever,/ And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.'\nKeats and Donne both know that death is a prat of life, and both poets use powerful imagery to talk about that difficult theme.The differences in this imagery show two very different attitudes toward the subject, one of...\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _   makes Keats's life worth living.\nOptions: A: expressing his grand passion for poetry\nB: walking on the shore with a pretty lady\nC: defeating nothingness with his true love\nD: pursuing the fame of being a romantic poet",

Therefore, even with today's  ly high standard of living, about 10 percent of the people in the United States are below the poverty line. However, if these people had stable jobs, they could have an acceptable standard of living. Economists suggest several reasons why poor people do not have jobs. \nFor one thing, more than half of the poor people in the United States are not qualified to work.

DRiWATER is a 100% natural, non-poisonous product used for the long-term watering of plants. It was invented by a well-known food chemist who recognized the potential of a filler product he was using to thicken peanut butter. He tested and applied his theory that water could be released over time as naturally occurring microbes   in the soil fed on the filler and released the water into the soil.\nThe inventor, Harold Jensen, tried for a long time to get the right recipe. He and his family worked nights and weekends testing different formulas. Jensen finally found the right formula and patented it.\nWhat are the ingredients in DRiWATER?

Only recently have they come to think of it as something to look through. Stores display their goods in large glass windows. Glass bottles and jars that hold food and drink allow us to see the contents. Glass is used to make eyeglasses, microscopes, telescopes, and many other extremely useful and necessary objects.\nUntil the Second World War, most of the glass used for optical  instruments was imported from Europe. However, during the war Americans could not get European glass, and they were forced to make their own. Therefore, new kinds of glasses were developed that had been previously unknown. These new effects were achieved by mixing other chemical elements with the sand. Some of these new glasses are very strong and can resist many kinds of shocks. Legend has it that a very hard glass was invented by a Roman who showed his discovery to the Emperor. When the Emperor saw the glass he feared that it would become more valuable than gold and sliver, making his treasure worthless. Therefore, he had the glassmaker killed, and the secret was not discovered again for hundreds of years.\nIn the present century, safety glass was invented for use in modern cars and planes. Safety glass is made by placing a layer of plastic between two layers of plate glass. When the outside layer of glass is broken, the pieces do not scatter  and injure people. Some glass of the type is strong enough to resist bullets .\nAlthough nowadays plastics have replaced glass under conditions where glass might be easily broken, there are new uses being developed, for the greatest advantage of glass is that its component  parts are inexpensive and can be found all over the world.\nQuestion: As time goes by, glass   _  .\nOptions: A: is regarded as transparent\nB: is used to make things look pleasant\nC: is seen as more than decoration\nD: is widely used to replace steel in making containers",

David Cameron, the present Prime Minister, said she had been a \"great Briton\" while US President Obama called her a \"great champion of freedom and liberty\". Her funeral is expected to be held next week. Thatcher, Britain's first female premier, was in power from 1979 to 1990 and won three successive general elections. She died \"peacefully\" after suffering a stroke on April 8th 2013. She will not have a state funeral but will be accorded the same status as Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. The Union Jack above Number 10 Downing Street has been lowered to half-mast to pay tributes.\n\"In an era in which politicians are all too often greeted with indifference, it is easy to forget that Britain was once led by a woman who inspired passion.\" says Nick Robinson, a well-known BBC political editor. \nAfter cutting short a trip to Europe to return to London, Cameron described Thatcher as \"the patriot prime minister\" and \"greatest peacetime\" leader. While acknowledging that she had \"divided opinion\", Cameron said she had \"taken a country that was on its knees and made it stand tall again.\" \"Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had,\" he added. Her other successors in No 10--- Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown --- paid tribute to her strength of character and political purpose while Labour leader Ed Miliband said Thatcher had been a \"unique figure\" who \"reshaped the politics of a whole generation.\"\nBut critics and her opponents questioned the economic and social impact of her policies, ex-Labour leader Lord Kinnock saying her economic policies had been a \"disaster for Britain\" at the time.

They may be capable of being extrovert   and sociable, but on some particular occasions, they are quiet.\nI have learnt from my experience that those who observe and listen more and talk less can gain a position of strength. This means that even a very shy person, the type who is reluctant to talk in company   , especially new company, can become a strong person in just about anything they choose. Remember, knowledge is power, and a shy introvert   is in a better position to gain knowledge than an extrovert. Introverted people can give great attention to learning, and as good listeners they can take in an enormous amount from others.

That described my life pretty well as a single mom. I was raising two teenagers on a teacher's aide's salary. It wasn't nearly enough to cover the bills, so I moonlighted as a waitress. Every time I thought that I had found a solution to my money worries, something would fall through and I would end up feeling worse off than before.\nThe next evening at the restaurant I tried on my apron, wishing I could be home with my kids. I walked up to my first table. Around it was a cheerful older couple. The woman gave me a smile that warmed me. I couldn't help but notice her unusual glass ring. \"What a beautiful ring,\" I said. We chatted for a minute then I took their order and left. When I came back with their drinks, the woman held out her ring. \"I would like to give this to you,\" she said.\n\"Oh, no, I couldn't,\" I said, embarrassed.\nShe gently placed the ring in my hand and closed my fingers around it. \"It's yours,\" she said. \"Please accept it and your things are going to be okay.\" Right there at their table in the middle of the restaurant I broke down in tears. \"Thank you for giving me hope,\" I said.\nLong after that night, that sense of peace stayed with me. I knew the right job would come in time. Nine months later it did. I got a better position at another school and I started waitressing at a restaurant where I was allowed to spend more time with my kids.\nNow in these tough times, I have money worries again, but they don't get me down. I know things will turn out okay. And when I wear that unusual glass ring, I'm reminded I'm not alone.\nQuestion: From the saying \"Two steps forward and three steps back\", it means the writer  _  .\nOptions: A: liked stepping forward and backward\nB: had difficulty raising her family\nC: couldn't walk regular like other people\nD: wanted to look for a better job",

A huge elephant,covered with dry mud,drank calmly and deeply. He might have traveled 50 km to reach the water. He wasn-t going to hurry now. He-d drink a while and then rest in the shade, and then drink again-or so we thought. What actually happened was that he drank deeply and stepped away. Then he suddenly fell down. Within minutes he was dead.\nWe called animal doctor Jeremiah Poghon immediately. He removed the head of a poisoned arrow from the eLephant s body,and let out over 100 litters of pus  -the result of the elephants meeting with a poacher months before.\nToday's poacher shoots from a blind. He fires an arrow,covered with poison,into the body of an elephant. If the poacher is lucky,the elephant might die in an hour or two; if not,he might have to follow the elephant for days before it dies. Often the arrow head fails to kill the elephant at once-it doesn't mean the poison won't finally kill the elephant,but it will be a slow death. Living in Tsavo through these times,l could see the results of poaching from time to time.\nWhen I think about the death of that elephant,what stays with me is the extraordinary silence after the shocking sound of his body hitting the ground.

People naturally want to follow a good leader. After meeting with an effective leader it is not unusual to feel uplifted , inspired, and motivated to work towards a common goal.\nAn effective leader makes others feel good about themselves, as well as the work they are doing. The leader has a vision of what he or she wants to achieve, and can communicate that vision to others in a way that makes people want to be part of it. One thing a good leader typically does is to communicate the big picture, so that each employee can see how the particular role he or she plays makes a contribution to the final result.\nGood leaders are positive and optimistic when they speak about the future.

It is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people every year. The London Eye is located at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames In the London Borough of Lambeth in England, between Westminster Bridge( which has longer history than the famous Severn Bridge to the west of London) and Hungerford Bridge. When erected in 1999, it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m Star of Nanchang in 2006, and the 165m Singapore Flyer in 2008. A breathtaking feat of design and engineering, passengers in the London Eye's capsules can see up to 40 kilometers in all directions.

Nowadays, they also live in Atlantic waters off the East Coast of the United States. These lionfish are what scientists call an invasive  species  or an \"alien invader.\" \nLocal divers off the coast of North Carolina were not expecting to see what they found one day in August 2002--the beautiful lionfish, common to the warm waters of the western Pacific, but unknown of the Carolina coast. They provided the first solid evidence that lionfish were in the Atlantic. \nA year later, scientists documented 19 lionfish sightings at eight locations along the North Carolina continental shelf. Then, lionfish were observed off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and even as far north as Long Island, New York! Between 2000 and 2003, lionfish sightings were reported at 16 different shipwrecks and natural hard bottom locations. During a summer 2004 research expedition, NOAA(The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists collected 155 lionfish at 19 different locations off the North Carolina coast alone. The jump in numbers and distributions over such a short time strongly indicates that the lionfish is reproducing in the Atlantic Ocean. If this is true, it's the first time that a western Pacific fish has populated the U.S. Atlantic coast.\nThese lionfish were likely released on purpose when people no longer wanted them! The swift and warm Gulf Stream, which transported the floating lionfish eggs from Florida northward, helped the lionfish's Atlantic journey. In Florida waters and along the continental shelf near the Gulf Stream the temperatures are very similar to the lionfish's native waters. \nHowever, from north Florida upward, the waters along the coastline are too cold in the winter for lionfish to survive. Scientists expect them to survive the winter only at water depths greater than 120ft because this is where the Gulf Stream has influence all year long.

We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.\nToday my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.\nTake Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.\nTake Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?\nTake Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.\nIn real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.\nI'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard?\nQuestion: According to the text, FaceBook tends to   _  .\nOptions: A: present another side of people\nB: offer some foods for free\nC: show endless advertisements\nD: get you to more parties",

Until recently, most of these ships were weak wooden sailing vessel  , their skeletons  quickly eaten away by sea creatures. Now, large vessels made of steel float on the seas. Thousands of these huge ships have been lost in times of war and in times of peace.\nThe bones of great metal ships, unlike the wooden vessels of old, survive the destruction of the sea long enough to become home and harbor for underwater life of all kinds. Shipwrecks  often provide the only hard surface and structure at the sandy bottom of the sea, something many sea creatures need.\nThe ship has been underwater for only five days. Its surface is still clean. Six weeks later, the wreck is covered with a slimy layer of algae , but it is still recognizable as a ship. Soon, animals that need to attach themselves to a hard surface, like the feather duster worms, make the wreck their home.\nIn warm waters, coral polyps  settle on the wreck and begin the process of building a rock-like _ on the ship. Small fish are attracted on all of these creatures. Larger fish come to feed on these small fish that hide in the wreckage. Eventually, the largest animals are attracted to the rich life on the shipwreck.\nShipwrecks give us valuable information about how sea plants and animals develop. We know exactly how long this wreck has been under water and how long sea life has been growing on it. Yet even the strongest steel shipwreck will finally be destroyed by the flows of water. But long after this wreck has been broken apart, it will still act as a reef  . Layer upon layer of sea life has formed a structure that is now more natural than artificial, and will remain an island of life under the sea.\nQuestion: The writer's purpose in writing the article is to tell us  _  .\nOptions: A: the differences between the ancient vessels and the modern ones\nB: how the ships become shipwrecks at sea\nC: how coral polyps live on the wreck in warm waters\nD: the value of studying shipwrecks at the bottom of the sea",

From this, it can be inferred that studying these wrecks underwater is important for understanding the development and life cycle of different aquatic flora and fauna. The value of researching shipwrecks under water makes up most of the content in this passage, so D would be an accurate answer to what was asked in question; whereas A-C are partial summaries or assumptions from statements made earlier in the text but do not accurately reflect why people study them.\nSo, option D is correct! ### D"

One day, he came to visit a saint  and asked to be his student. The saint offered some tea. He slowly filled the scholar's cup: the cup was full, yet he kept pouring. The scholar couldn't help bursting out, \"Stop! You can't add anything to something that's already full!\" The saint set down the teapot and replied, \"Exactly.\"\n   Whether it's the silence between notes in music, or some open time in your schedule, you need space to act effectively. Yet most of us, myself included, tend to stuff as much as possible into whatever room is available - closets, schedules, budgets, relationships, and even the mind itself.\n   However, some people know how to avoid overstuffing their life. For example, in Australia, it seemed that most people there operated at about 85% of their capacity, unlike Americans pushing as close as to 100% as possible. So when you run into Australians you know in the street, they have time to hang out and talk with you.\n   Remember the cup: its value is in the space, the emptiness it holds. How to empty your \"cup\" ?\n   Be mindful of the element of space, openness, and emptiness in your life. This includes room in a drawer, the volume of air in a kitchen, and open-mindedness in a friend. Sometimes you're just stuck with a big bucket of tasks yet to do. But at least empty the bucket faster than you fill it with new tasks. Put some space between finishing one thing and starting another. For example, after sending one email, take a breath before replying to another one. Drop the stuff you can no longer afford to lug around. At sea level, you can run with a brick in your backpack, but if you're hiking on a mountain, that brick has to go.\nQuestion: The saint probably wanted to tell the scholar by pouring water into the cup, that   _  .\nOptions: A: he should be diligent in order to succeed\nB: he had already gained enough knowledge\nC: he ought to pay attention to details\nD: he should keep learning every day",

The story suggests that by continuing to study, even if he never learned anything new, this would be doing as much as possible with what he knows and has now; it is also wasting time because there are other opportunities in life besides studying endlessly each day. So B makes sense here.\n\n\nA:’s answer choice says “he should be diligent in order to succeed” which does not make sense since we don’t know exactly how the saint defines success or whether learning more will lead him towards his goal for success. \nC’s answer choices says \"He ought to pay attention to details\" but nothing about paying attention is mentioned anywhere in the ### B"

From the ancient Greeks and Romans to current day writers and professors, the debate about happiness continues. What makes someone happy? In what parts of the world are people the happiest? Why even study happiness? The Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a person's highest happiness comes from the use of his or her intelligence. Religious books such as the Koran and Bible discuss faith as a form of happiness. The British scientist Charles Darwin believed that all species were formed in a way so as to enjoy happiness. People throughout history may have had different ideas about happiness. But today, many people are still searching for its meaning.\nHow do you study something like happiness? You could start with the World Database of Happiness at Erasmus University in prefix = st1 /Rotterdam, The Netherlands. This set of information includes how to define and measure happiness. Some findings are not surprising. For example, the database suggests that married people are happier than single people. People who like to be with other people are happier than unsocial people. But other findings are less expected: People with children are equally happy as couples without children. And wealthier people are only a little happier than poorer people.\nPositive psychology is the new term for a method of scientific study that tries to examine the things that make life worth living instead of life's problems. Traditional psychology generally studies negative situations like mental suffering and sickness. But positive psychology aims to study the strengths that allow people and communities to do well. There is also an increasing amount of medical research on the physical qualities of happiness. Doctors can now look at happiness at work in a person's brain using a method called magnetic resonance imaging  , or MRI. For example, an MRI can show how one area of a person's brain activates when he or she is shown happy pictures.
