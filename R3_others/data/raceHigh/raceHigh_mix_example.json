The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies.\nHowever, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information   to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer   and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones.\nThey have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements.\n\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...\nQuestion: What is the primary benefit of using smart phones with embedded inertial sensors?\nOptions: A: They require new equipment, such as RFID technologies.\nB: They can track pedestrian movement indoors with GPS.\nC: No additional infrastructure would be needed.\nD: No additional money would be spent.\n\n### Response: The article states that the primary benefit of using inertial sensors in smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements.

However, they are being told more needs to be done to stop them injuring at work. One in five British workplace deaths happens in agriculture even though farmers are only a small part of the working population. During the year 2012/13 there were 1,061 injuries in total and it is thought many more go unreported.\nJim Chapman from Warwickshire had his arm torn off by farm machinery seven years ago when he was 23. \"You don't realize how much you rely on your second arm until it's gone,\" he said. He fell against a PTO shaft  , a spinning metal bar at the back of a tractor. \"It catapulted   me from one side of the machine to the other,\" he said. \"I landed on the floor, minus all my clothing.

As a fairytale city, Zurich is set on the banks of both a river and a lake, with the snow-topped Swiss Alps rising in the background. Clean cobblestone streets hug a hilly land and medieval   church tops reach heavenward. Despite its reputation for being the center of old-school international banking and a capital for chocolate, Zurich is also a very modern city that chooses to enjoy life at an unhurried pace. Travelers desiring a real experience should strive to do the same.\nThe City of Angels\n The City of Angels, the Entertainment Capital of the World--Los Angeles needs no introduction. But its notoriety   both helps and hurts its reputation. The traffic on the \"101\" will tire you out just as much as an evening at a lively West Hollywood club. And your dislike at the thick smog over the city will ruin your enjoyment of a sunset overlooking Santa Monica Beach. To appreciate Los Angeles, visit the area more than once and get advice from locals.\nPrague \n A prosperous and busy city, Prague now attracts more tourists than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils   both a dark legacy and a resilient   past; in its 1,100 years, Prague has survived numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets, hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most tired traveler would have trouble resisting this city's charms.\nPuerto Rico \n Pick a vacation experience you're looking for, and Puerto Rico can help.

That means that while Italians may enjoy a glass of wine or beer, they don't usually get very drunk.\nThat's not true anymore. The new study by the Italian National Health Institute found that 63 percent of Italians under age 18 get drunk on the weekends. Now, the city of Milan has created a law that will stop anyone under 16 from buying alcohol. Anyone who sells or gives alcohol to a person under 16 can be fined up to $700.\nYoung people who feel that the new law is unfair should go to the US for some perspective. The US has the highest drinking age in the world: It's illegal for anyone under 21 to buy alcohol, and stores or restaurants that are caught selling alcohol to people under the legal age risk losing their licenses.\nMany young Americans complain that the drinking laws are unfair: They are allowed to vote in elections and join the military at age 18, so why wait another three years just to buy a bottle of beer?\nThese young people have found help in an unusual place. Last year, more than 100 presidents of US universities joined together to ask lawmakers to consider changing the drinking age. They argued that the law doesn't stop underage college kids from getting drunk - it just makes them want to drink more.\nFor now, the law seems unlikely to change. But US teenagers who want alcohol can go north to Canada, where the drinking age is 18-19, or south to Mexico where the legal age is 18. Throughout much of Asia, Africa and Europe, the legal drinking age ranges 16-18.\nIn plenty of places though, the official drinking age is ignored, and even young children can buy alcohol if they have the money to pay for it.\nNo matter how old you are, you should always be responsible with alcohol.

This beautifully animated film is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone.The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's\nattention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship.What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised.\nThe promising Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan.Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper,  it doesn't _ itself immediately,  and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering ( ), so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter ,for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration.The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass,  supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead.\nFor days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist. When Terrence accidentally breaks the Moon Stone, Tinker Bell \"explodes and sends him away.One of Tinker's more literal friends finds this extremely concerning, as she doesn't' quite understand\nthat the outburst was emotional rather than physical - very funny indeed.\nAfter hearing the legend of the lost treasure, Tinker Bell strikes out on her own to find a new Moon Stone.She faces many difficulties and meets new friends along the way, but when Terrence comes to the rescue at Tinker's darkest hour, she realizes the value of a truly loyal friend.

Sometimes it is the ordinary nature of these objects that actually makes them so extraordinary. Such is the case with an old leather shoe in a museum in Alaska. At first glance it does not look like much. It is a woman's shoe of a style popular in the 1890s. But what is unique  about this shoe is where it was found. It was discovered on the Checkout Pass, the famous trail used by the people seeking gold in Alaska. Who it belonged to or why it was left there is not known. Was it perhaps dropped by accident as the woman climbed up the 1500 stairs carved outface? Or did she throw away goods that she didn't need in order to travel lighter?\nOver 100, 000 people with \"gold fever\" made this trip hoping to become millionaires. Few of them understood that on their way they would have to cross a harsh wildness. Unprepared for such a dangerous journey, many died of starvation and exposure to the cold weather.\nThe Canadian government finally started requiring the gold seekers to bring one ton of supplies with them. This was thought to be enough for a person to survive for one year. They would carry their supplies in backpacks  each weighing up to fifty pounds; it usually took at least 40 trips to get everything to the top and over the pass.

But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry  of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects.\nIn some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits.\nThe sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation.\nThe Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings.\nIt is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s.

Instead, plants produce volatile compounds   ---- chemicals that easily change from a liquid to a gas. A flower's sweet smell, for example, comes from such volatile compounds to attract insects such as bugs and bees.\nPlants can also discover  volatile compounds produced by other plants. A tree under attack by hungry insets, for instance, may give off these chemicals in order to let other trees know about the attack. In response, the other trees may send off their chemicals to keep the bugs away ---- or even chemicals that will attract the bugs' natural enemies.\nNow scientists have created a quick way to understand what plants are saying: a chemical sensor   called an \"electronic nose\". The \"e-nose\" can tell such compounds as plants make. When plants are attacked, scientists say, the e-nose could help quickly decide whether plants are being eaten by insects. But today, the only way to spot such insects is to inspect individual plants by observing them. This is a challenging task for managers of greenhouses, including those that can house thousands of plants. The research team is working with an e-nose that can recognize volatile compounds. Inside the device, 13 sensors chemically react with volatile compounds based on the interactions  , and then the e-nose will give off electronic signals that the scientists can analyze by using computer software.\nTo test the e-nose, the team presented it with healthy leaves from cucumber, pepper and tomato plants, all being common greenhouse crops. Then scientists collected samples of the air around damaged leaves from each type of crop. These plants had been damaged either by insects or by scientists who made holes in the leaves with a hole punch  .\nThe e-nose, it turns out, can identify healthy cucumber, pepper and tomato plants based on the volatile compounds they produce.

Until recently, most of these ships were weak wooden sailing vessel  , their skeletons  quickly eaten away by sea creatures. Now, large vessels made of steel float on the seas. Thousands of these huge ships have been lost in times of war and in times of peace.\nThe bones of great metal ships, unlike the wooden vessels of old, survive the destruction of the sea long enough to become home and harbor for underwater life of all kinds. Shipwrecks  often provide the only hard surface and structure at the sandy bottom of the sea, something many sea creatures need.\nThe ship has been underwater for only five days. Its surface is still clean. Six weeks later, the wreck is covered with a slimy layer of algae , but it is still recognizable as a ship. Soon, animals that need to attach themselves to a hard surface, like the feather duster worms, make the wreck their home.\nIn warm waters, coral polyps  settle on the wreck and begin the process of building a rock-like _ on the ship. Small fish are attracted on all of these creatures. Larger fish come to feed on these small fish that hide in the wreckage. Eventually, the largest animals are attracted to the rich life on the shipwreck.\nShipwrecks give us valuable information about how sea plants and animals develop. We know exactly how long this wreck has been under water and how long sea life has been growing on it. Yet even the strongest steel shipwreck will finally be destroyed by the flows of water. But long after this wreck has been broken apart, it will still act as a reef  .

Three-D printers are used to make everything from automobile parts to bone replacements for human patients. American research scientists are now working on creating replacements for living tissue.\nResearchers at the Medical University of South Carolina have been working on creating and manufacturing living tissue since 2003.This process is called biofabrication   . It requires special printing equipment and a special kind of ink.\nTraditional printers require ink to produce an image or design on a piece of paper. For their three-D printer, the South Carolina researchers prepare complex nutritious solutions they call bio-inks. Bio-inks are made of proteins and glucose   , which normally provides energy for most cells of the body. The researchers also add living cells taken from the animal that will receive the new, printed tissue. The bio-inks are then added to a device that researchers call the Palmetto bio-printer.\nSarah Grace Dennis is one of the researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina. She says new technology, like the Palmetto bio-printer, is a great help to the biofabrication process.\nThe bio-inks are placed in three dispensers   , containers, inside the printer. Lasers control both the position of the printing surface and the places where the bio-ink is released.\nMichael Yost is a leader of the research team. He says the printing process is fully automated-- machine-operated.

He says research has shown that wild plants and animals are moving toward Earth's North and South poles as the planet warms.\nMr Bebber wanted to know if the same thing was happening with organisms that attack agricultural crops. He examined reports of first sightings of new insects and diseases around the world. The records came from CABI - the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International. He says the group began collecting information from developing and industrialized countries years ago.\nDan Bebber and his research team studied 612 different organisms - from viruses and bacteria to insects like beetles and butterflies. They found that since 1960, crop pests and diseases have been moving toward the poles at an average rate of about 3 kilometers each year. Mr Bebber says this puts the most productive farmland in the world in danger.\n\"As new species of pests and diseases evolve and potentially the environment for them becomes more _ at higher latitudes, the pressure on the breadbaskets of the world is going to increase.\"\nFarmers face other threats.

The junior mountaineer from Big Bear Lake, California has been hooked on climbing from an early age. When he was just 10, he became the youngest person to climb Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak at 5895 meters.\n    Before his 11th birthday, he had another world record under his belt, summiting Europe's Mt Elbrus, in Russia's Caucasus mountains, in July 2007.

Milk contains calcium , which is necessary for keeping bones and teeth healthy and strong. The US government even requires milk as part of the National School Lunch Program, saying that students should drink one cup of fat-free or low-fat milk every meal.\nHowever, a group of doctors asked the government to take it away from the lunch program. The US 'Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) says, \"Milk is high in sugar, fat and animal protein,\" all of which have negative effects on health. The PCRM says there are better and healthier ways to get calcium such as eating beans, broccoli, cereals and tofu. Orange juice and soymilk that have calcium added to them also supply the nutrient. \"One of the only reasons people prefer milk is that it is going to help build strong bones,\" says Dr Neal Barnard, president of the PCRM. But milk may not be the best way to get calcium your body needs.\nOf course, calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth, but there are other things that affect your bone strength, such as genes, how much vitamin D you take in, and getting an hour's worth of exercise every day.\nSome people disagree with the idea that milk isn't important. Keri Gans, an American Dietitian, says \"I don't think it's irresponsible to take this beverage that children enjoy it very much, especially among those who are unable to meet their nutrient needs for the day, and remove it from the lunch line.\"\nThe U.S government is now considering the request of the PCRM, but a decision may be a long way off.

Although Keats didn't receive much formal literary education, his own studies and passion brought him much success. Additionally, his own life situation influenced his poetry greatly. \nGrowing up as a young kid in London in a lower, middle-class family, the young John didn't attend a private school, but went to public school in Enfield, near his home. His teachers and his family's friends regarded him as an optimistic boy who liked playing and fighting much more than minding his studies. After his father's death in the early 1800s, followed by his mother's passing away due to illness, he began to view life differently. He wanted to escape the world and did so by reading anything he could get his hands on.\nAt around the age of 16, the teenage John Keats began studying under a surgeon so that he too might become a doctor. However, his literary appetite had taken too much of his time, especially with his addiction to the poetry of Edmund Spenser. He was able to have his first full poem published in the Examinerin 1816, namedO Solitude! If I must with thee dwell. Within two months in 1817, Keats had written an entire volume of poetry that would be published, but criticized sharply in Blackwood's Magazine. However, the negative response didn't stop him.\nJohn Keats' next work to be published was Endymion, which he wrote in 1817 and was published in May 1818. The story involves a boy who falls in love with the moon goddess and leads him on an adventure of one boy's hope to overcome the limitations of being human. FollowingEndymion, he wroteIsabella. During this time, John Keats began seeing his limitations in poetry due to his own limit in life experiences. He would have to have the \"knowledge\" associated with his poems.

Three windmills  were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97.\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital.\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power.\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption.\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares.\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you...\nQuestion: Denmark has decided to build windmills in its capital mainly to   _  .\nOptions: A: make windmills its cultural symbol\nB: advocate an environmentally-friendly lifestyle\nC: take advantage of its limited wind power\nD: greet tourists coming to Copenhagen by plane\n\n### Response: The article outlines how Denmark is building windmills within its capital city.

Recently there has been something of a recovery in cycling , and in many areas it is a very useful way of getting around , especially where bike paths or bike routes have been built . You may well want to buy , hire or borrow a bike .\nThere are two important results of this earlier drop in cycling in the USA . One is that many people do not know how to cycle . That is , cyclists often behave more like walkers than motorists : they ride in the sidewalk or on the wrong side of the road ; they do not care for stop signs or traffic lights ; they ride without lights at night ; they give no signals .\nThe other result is that cycling is regarded by many people not so much as a way of getting from one place to another but as a way of life , a form of exercise , etc . As a result , large numbers of young Americans have ten-speed racing bikes . These are very high and fast and great if you are cycling long distance , riding up mountains or racing . At first , though , you may find them convenient for cycling in town , sightseeing or shopping --they are expensive , uncomfortable and hard to control until you get used to them , and unsuitable for rough stony roads .\nThere are also ordinary bikes around . If you get hold of one of these ,you may find that the brakes  work by pedaling   backwards . This is perhaps safer than ordinary brakes when it is wet , but it seems to be less effective .

Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to regret and prepare for Christ's death and coming back to life.\nModern Brazilian Carnival dates back to Rio de Janeiro in 1641. It originally copied the European form of the festival, later taking in elements of Native American and African cultures.\nIn the late 19th century, the strings   were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant   groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as blocks, consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes or logos. Blocks are generally connected with particular neighborhoods; they include both a music group and a lot of revelers.\nBlock parades have become an expressive feature of Rio's Carnival. Today, they number more than 100 and the groups increase each year. Blocks can be formed by small or large groups of revelers with a clear title. Before the show, they gather in a square, then parade in sections of the city, often near the beach.\nCarnival time in Rio is very interesting, but is also the most expensive time to visit Rio. Hotel rooms and other lodgings   can be up to four times more expensive than the regular rates. There are big crowds at some locations and life is far from ordinary in many parts of town.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly about?\nOptions: A: The famous carnivals in the world.\nB: How the carnival was introduced in Brazil.\nC: The carnival in Rio de Janeiro.\nD: The happy life of the people in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n### Response: The question is asking which option best describes the topic of the passage.

Every person perceives himself to have a sort of invisible shield surrounding his physical body. When someone comes too close, he feels uncomfortable. When he bumps onto someone, he feels obligated to apologize. But the size of a person's \"comfort zone\" depends on his cultural ethnic origin. For example, in casual conversation, many Americans stand about four feet apart. In other words, they like to keep each other \"at arm's length\", people in Latin or Arab cultures, in contrast, stand very close to each other, and touch each other often. If someone from one of those cultures stands too close to an American while in conversation, the American may feel uncomfortable and back away.\nWhen Americans are talking, they expect others to respond to what they are saying. To Americans, polite conversationalists empathize by displaying expressions of excitement or disgust, shock or sadness. People with a \"poker face\", whose emotions are hidden by a deadpan expression, are looked upon with suspicion. Americans also indicate their attentiveness in a conversation by raising their eyebrows, nodding, smiling politely and maintaining good eye contact. Whereas some cultures view direct eye contact as impolite or threatening, Americans see it as a sign of genuineness and honesty.

He said his team was \"trying to modify pigs so their organs might save the lives of humans.\" \nThe scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to reduce the chances of the organs being rejected by patients, as has been common in previous attempts to use animal tissues, said Winston, who heads the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology at London's Hammersmith Hospital. \nWorking with Dr. Carol Redhead of the California Institute of Technology, Winston's team has injected human genes directly into male piglets , adding them to the animal's sperm . \nHe said that pigs involved in experiments had successfully produced transgenic sperm, but acknowledged that British and European laws had prevented the team from using the pigs to mate. \nThe Sunday Times newspaper reported that the experiments would be moved to the United States following difficulties with funding and regulations in Britain. It said the pigs would be bred in Missouri. \n\"Our U.S. friends will benefit from our technology and the income we might have produced for Britain will be lost,\" Winston wrote. \nSome scientists have previously blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant, saying the technique risks spreading animal viruses to humans. Winston said his research project is attempting to breed virus-free pigs.\nQuestion: Scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to   _  .\nOptions: A: make the organs healthier\nB: reduce the pain of animals\nC: make the organs live longer\nD: reduce the chances of rejection\n\n### Response: ",

The sea covers three quarters of the world. It looks very pretty when the sun is shining on it. It can be very rough when there is a big wind.\nThe sea is also very deep in some places. Some parts of the sea are very shallow. But in some places the depth of the sea is very great. There is one spot, near Japan, where the sea is nearly 11 kilometers deep! The highest mountain in the world is about 9 kilometers high. If that mountain were put into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it!\nThe sea is salty. Rivers, which flow into the sea, carry salt from the land into the sea. Some parts of the sea are more salty than other parts. There is one sea, called the Dead Sea, which is very salty. It is so salty that swimmers can't sink! Fish can't live in the Dead Sea!\nThe sea can be very cold. Divers, who go deep down in the sea, know this. On the top the water may be warm. When the diver goes downwards, the sea becomes colder and colder. Another thing happens. When the diver goes deeper, the water above presses down on him. It squeezes him. Then the diver has to wear clothes made of metal. But he cannot go very deep. Some people who wanted to go very deep used a very strong diving ship! They went down to a depth of eleven kilometers.\nQuestion: The saltier the sea is,_.\nOptions: A: the easier people can swim in it\nB: the more the fish can live in\nC: the more dangerous it will be\nD: the more floating things there will ba\n\n### Response: The article provides information about the saltiness of different bodies of water. The Dead Sea is salty and so people can \"float\" on top without sinking. A diver could sink in another body of water, but as they go deeper into a sea that is more saline it would be easier to rise back up because there are fewer forces pushing them down (the buoyancy force increases with increasing salinity). So since the saltier the waters are, then less effort will need to be made by swimmers or divers at those depths than if they were swimming or diving in an area where there was less salinity and hence lower density (gre",

While one of the intruders pointed a gun at the group, the other two scooped up $4,400 worth of laptops, cell phones, video games and cash. Once they had what they wanted, the trio fled into the night.\nFurious, the students chased down and tackled one of the burglars -- the one with the gun. In the struggle, it went off, and a bullet grazed a student's leg. His friends piled on the gunman and held him until police showed up.\nBy the next day, the injured young man was back in his apartment, and the suspect was in jail, charged with burglary, felonious assault and receiving stolen property. But how did the men manage to storm into an on-campus residence that November night in the first place? Simple: Students told police the building's main doors hadn't latched properly for days.\nAs parents confront ballooning college costs and shrinking acceptance rates, they are finding themselves with an even bigger, more basic problem: Which campuses are safe? Colleges seem like idyllic and secure places, and for the most part, they are. But ivy-covered walls can't keep out every bad element. This country's 6,000 colleges and universities report some 40,000 burglaries, 3,700 forcible sex offenses, 7,000 aggravated assaults and 48 murders a year. Other hazards -- fires, binge-drinking, mental-health problems -- are also on the rise.\nOf course, that's not what parents and students see on America's serene campuses. There's a false sense of security, says Harry Nolan, a safety consultant in New York City. \"Students see guards patrolling at night or a video camera monitoring the dorm entrance and think, nothing bad can happen to me,\" he explains. \"People don't know that safety controls are often very lax.\"\nQuestion: Which is right according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Their children's grades in are high.\nB: Their children's safety in the universities or colleges will be mornitored well.\nC: The universities or colleges don't pay much attention to the children.\nD: The universities or colleges are not key educational departments in the local area.\n\n### Response: ",

Now new research suggests that some dreams may result from the brain's effort to keep learning, even as we sleep.\nIn a study in Boston, 100 volunteers were trained for an hour on a maze  .They tried to find their way through the difficult puzzle as quickly as possible. Then half of the volunteers were allowed to sleep for 90 minutes. The other half stayed awake, reading or relaxing. The ones who slept were asked to describe their dreams when they woke up.\nAfter the rest, the volunteers were asked again to solve the maze. Those who hadn't slept showed no improvement or did even worse after the break. Sleepers who didn't report any maze related dreams did better but showed only a little improvement. However, four nap-takers who reported dreaming about the maze showed a surprising improvement.

Every person perceives himself to have a sort of invisible shield surrounding his physical body. When someone comes too close, he feels uncomfortable. When he bumps onto someone, he feels obligated to apologize. But the size of a person's \"comfort zone\" depends on his cultural ethnic origin. For example, in casual conversation, many Americans stand about four feet apart. In other words, they like to keep each other \"at arm's length\", people in Latin or Arab cultures, in contrast, stand very close to each other, and touch each other often. If someone from one of those cultures stands too close to an American while in conversation, the American may feel uncomfortable and back away.\nWhen Americans are talking, they expect others to respond to what they are saying. To Americans, polite conversationalists empathize by displaying expressions of excitement or disgust, shock or sadness. People with a \"poker face\", whose emotions are hidden by a deadpan expression, are looked upon with suspicion. Americans also indicate their attentiveness in a conversation by raising their eyebrows, nodding, smiling politely and maintaining good eye contact. Whereas some cultures view direct eye contact as impolite or threatening, Americans see it as a sign of genuineness and honesty.

When things go bad for the Brazilian team, the newspapers would demand that the team manager should leave his job. \"If we win, they me in heaven,\" a manager once said. \"If we lose, they put me in hell .\"\nYou can't escape football in Brazil. There are football matches on every street and beach. On television, the results of football matches come before the main news programs. There are six television channels  in Rio de Janeiro. On Sundays each channel shows a different football match.\nBrazil is not the richest country in the world, but the government spends lots of money on football. It cost more than one billion pounds to prepare for the 1978 World Cup. That's 10 pounds for every Brazilian man, woman, and child. And many Brazilians don't earn as much as 10 pounds a week.

The  Treaty   of Rome ,which created the organization that finally became the EU,  stated that each country's language must be treated equally. The original six countries had only three languages between them: French, German and Dutch/Flemish. However, there are now 15 countries in the EU, with a total of 12 languages. EU documents must be translated into all these languages, and at official meetings the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters.\nAll this translating is very expensive and time-consuming. It is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches and nearly half of the EU's administrative   costs are spent on this task. In the near future it is probable that several more countries, most of them having their own languages, will join the EU, thus making the situation even worse.\nThe problem is just cost; there are practical difficulties as well. With 12 languages, there are 132 possible \"translation situations\" that might be needed. It is often difficult to find people in the right place at the right time who can translate from, for example, Danish into Greek, or Dutch into Portuguese, at a high professional standard.\nIn practice the problem has been less serious by the use of English in many contacts between EU officials , since almost all of them speak some English. However, any move to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller countries. Another commonly suggested solution is to make English the official language for all EU business. However, this is strongly resisted by powerful member countries like France and Germany .\nQuestion: What's the main purpose of this passage?\nOptions: A: To show that the problem cannot be solved .\nB: To criticize the European Union for inefficiency .\nC: To find out a problem and show how serious it is.\nD: To give a solution to a problem .\n\n### Response: The passage explores the problem of language within the European Union (EU), and demonstrates",

After high school, Lin sent his resume  and a DVD of highlights to all the Ivy League schools, and his dream schools Stanford and UCLA. Harvard and Brown were the only schools that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships.\nAfter graduating from Harvard University, Lin went undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft . Lin spent his first season with his hometown the Golden State Warriors. He saw limited minutes with the Warriors, but was cheered in arenas  around the country, particularly in cities with large Asian communities, as fans came out in crowds to cheer their homegrown star. In late 2011, Lin spent less than two weeks with the Houston Rockets, moving to the New York Knicks at the very end of the year.\nHe has made several trips to the NBA's Development League, a minor league for players who show promise but need seasoning before they can compete at the highest level. It appears to have paid off. In February 2012, after keying the Knicks victory over New Jersey, Lin was named the starter for the Utah game, a position he appears to have a hold on in the short term, as Baron Davis, who signed in December to play the position, stays on the disabled list. Lin will likely get stronger the more minutes he plays, and even if Davis returns, spelling the older, recovering player could be productive for Lin: a proven good student who can learn a lot from practicing against a veteran.\nWithout the services of All-Stars Carmelo and Amare, Lin led New York to a 4-0 record last week.

It's fitting, then, the Italian Gulielmo Marconi should have chosen this site   to receive the world's first radio signal -- in Morse code -- from England on December 12, 1901. \n    Marconi, combining earlier ideas with his own, led us to a new communications age. For the next 50 years, until the appearance of television, radio ruled the air waves.\n    Today, it's the TV that rules. No single person can say to have invented television.\n    In 1884, the German Paul Nipkow invented a device   that sent pictures mechanically  , and in 1906, Boris Rosing, a Russian, used a ray and a disc to create the world's first TV system. Then in the early 1920s, another Russian, Vladimir Zworykin,invented a picture display tube. He took out a patent   for color1 TV, even though it wouldn't be developed for another 25 years. \n    In 1924, a Scot entered the scene -- John Logie Baird. He first succeeded in sending a moving picture and a year later got the first actual TV picture. In 1926, Baird showed TV in aLondonlaboratory. Two years later inNew York, Felix the Cat became the first TV star.\nTV excited everyone's imagination, but hardly anyone had a set, with just two thousand in use worldwide in the mid-1930s. \nSince the late 1940s, TV technology has developed very quickly.

This doesn't sound much, but a 5degC change is the difference between the current warm period and an ice age.\nGlobal warming leads to other changes in the climate: melting ice, more evaporation , changes in geographical patterns of rainfall, heavier downpours separated by longer dry spells, more frequent heat waves, more intense hurricanes, and sea level rise.\nThese changes could affect crop growth as drought, increased evaporation and shrinking glaciers disrupt water supply. Some crops could suffer heat stress. While there may be benefits in some regions, overall climate change is likely to have a negative impact on global food supplies. The impacts of climate change on agriculture will vary widely around the world. A global temperature rise of 1-2 degC is expected to increase food production in some regions, particularly mid-latitude areas. But in tropical regions even a small amount of warming could reduce crop yields. A temperature rise of 3 degC or more could threaten global food resources, as all regions are likely to experience negative impacts overall.\nFreshwater resources could also diminish, especially in tropical regions, as rain patterns change and evaporation speeds up.

Dogs are often used in search and rescue operations and to sniff for things like drugs and explosives. Some dogs have even been trained to sniff for cancer in people.\nResearchers have been trying to reproduce the extraordinary sense of smell that real dogs are born with. Now, officials at the Glasgow airport in Scotland are testing a new security device called an \"electronic sniffer dog\". The electronic sniffer dog represents one of the latest developments in the area of smell technology.\nA Scottish company, Cascade Technologies, joined with the French security company Morpho to develop it. The device uses lasers to identify explosive materials in gases in the air. The purpose is to identify explosives that may be hidden on a person's body.\nThe machine looks similar to the metal detectors now used at airports. Passengers walk through the machine as the lasers test the surrounding air. People are not required to take off their coats, belts or shoes as part of the security process. And, unlike full-body scanners, the new device does not show images of the passengers.\nOfficials at Cascade Technologies say the machine can process one person per second and produce almost immediate results. They say future development could cut security processing times at airports by screening all passengers at walking speed.\nProfessor Yushan Yan, the head of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Riverside, points out that unlike real dogs, electronic devices do not get tired or need to be walked or require food and water. Professor Yan says real dogs also have other needs. \"They also need very extensive training that could be expensive.

Where do the yellows and oranges come from? To answer those questions, we first have to understand what leaves are and what they do.\nLeaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. They take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose, which is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis, which means \" putting together with light. \" A chemical called chlorophyll helps make photosynthesis happen. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color.\nAs summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how the trees \"know\" to begin getting ready for winter.\nDuring winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. The trees will rest, and live off the food they stored during summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors. Small a-mounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along. Covered up by the green chlorophyll, we just can't see them in summer.\nThe bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall. In some trees, like maples, glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn cause the leaves turn this glucose into a red color. The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves.\nIt is the combination of all these things that make the beautiful colors we enjoy in the fall.\nQuestion: Which is the best title for this passage?\nOptions: A: Colorful trees in autumn\nB: Mysteries of tree colors\nC: Do you enjoy tree colors?\nD: Wonderful colors in autumn\n\n### Response: ",

But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry  of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects.\nIn some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits.\nThe sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation.\nThe Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes.

The price of professional childcare has been rising since the 1980s. Yet during that time, pay for professional childcare workers has stood still. Actually caregivers   earn less today than they did in 1990. Considering that labor costs are responsible for about 80% of a daycare center's expenses, one would infer that stable wages means stable prices.\nSo who is to blame for higher child care costs?\nChildcare is a carefully regulated industry. States lay down rules about how many children each employee is allowed to watch over, the space care centers need per child, and other details. And the stricter the regulations are, the higher the costs will be. In Massachusetts, where childcare centers must hire one teacher for every three infants, the price of care averaged more than $ 16,000 per year. In Mississippi, where centers must hire one teacher for every five infants, the price of care averaged less than $5,000.\nUnfortunately I don't have all the daycare center regulations, but I wouldn't be surprised if as the rules have become more complicated, prices have risen. The tradeoff   might be worth it in certain cases; after all, the health and safety of children should probably come before cheap service. But certainly, it doesn't seem to be an accident that some of the cheapest daycare available is in the least regulated South.\nQuestion: What does the author feel puzzled about?\nOptions: A: Why the prices of child care vary greatly from state to state.\nB: Why increased child care prices have not led to better service.\nC: Why childcare workers' pay has not increased with the rising childcare costs\nD: Why there is a severe shortage of childcare professionals in a number of states.\n\n### Response: The author is puzzled by the fact that childcare workers' pay has remained stagnant during a period of rising prices for childcare. The article explains that 8 0% of costs at a daycare center go to paying worker salaries, so one would expect wages and costs to rise together[1]. While there are other possible",

The deal means that Rowling's long-standing relationship with Bloomsbury, the London-based publisher that launched the Harry Potter books, has come to an end, at least in terms of new works by the author. Rowling, who is worth an estimated PS530 million, said that the new novel will be nothing like the Harry Potter series, which sold over 30 million copies in the UK alone. She said that with the move from children's to adult fiction, a move to a new publisher seemed like a logical step. \nItem 2:  China's hurdler Liu Xiang was disqualified Thursday at the Stockholm indoor athletics tournament due to false start, giving his rival Dayron Robles of Cuba an easy win of 7.66 seconds.

Another Cuban Orlando Ortega followed in 7.68 seconds and Balazs Baji of Hungary stood third in 7.70 seconds.

The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.\nWhen Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.\nLee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances.

They were very large, so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the poor girl had lost them in running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it. So the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold.

But Chinese people have now changed their attitude toward beauty contest, although some men will still be shouting that the winner is no more beautiful than his wife or his former girl friend or even his mother in a sour tone. But such men are not shouting for the right reason. The question to be asked is : Why isn't there a Mr. World Beauty Contest?\nAnd a further question to be asked is: Does taking part in a beauty contest show a woman's  courage, wisdom and liberation or rather the opposite - a forced choice and a revolting act made under conditions of long-term discrimination?\nOrganizers of such beauty contests claim that the contestants are judged on qualities other than just their physical appearance. But still no answer is given to why there isn't a Mr. Beauty or a Mr. World Contest? Or at least, why isn't that kind of contest popular? Why is it that only women's \"qualities\" need to be recognized but not men's?\nThink about who is always standing beside a fancy car on show? Is it a boy or a girl? And this is how \"qualities\" are judged: if the girl looks good, there is little reason why the car beside her is not of high quality.\nThe beauty contests go on year after year, with winners enjoying fame which quickly disappears.

Earlier in the poem, Keats says that he hopes this 'Love' will be a 'high romance' with a 'fair creature.' He also says that he hopes the 'Fame' he seeks will be the result of the 'high piled books' produced by his 'crowded brain.' In other words, Keats's fear is that death is a 'nothingness' that will arrive before he can finish his life's work or find his true love.\nDonne has a different attitude toward death, and so the imagery in his poem is different, too.To Donne, death should 'be not proud,' because it is not 'mighty and dreadful.' Unlike Keats, Donne sees death as weak and merely a 'slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men.' He also says that death is like 'rest and sleep'.Donne believes that we will all wake from the sleep of death to everlasting life, just as we wake from our normal sleep to our everyday lives.In fact, Donne believes that it is death itself that will die: 'One short sleep past, we wake forever,/ And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.'\nKeats and Donne both know that death is a prat of life, and both poets use powerful imagery to talk about that difficult theme.The differences in this imagery show two very different attitudes toward the subject, one of...\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _   makes Keats's life worth living.\nOptions: A: expressing his grand passion for poetry\nB: walking on the shore with a pretty lady\nC: defeating nothingness with his true love\nD: pursuing the fame of being a romantic poet\n\n### Response: Keats believes that death is a 'nothingness', and he fears dying before finishing his life's work or finding true love.

Test yourself. This will help you to understand as well as learn faster because it is more active than reading or listening. It will also help you to notice your mistakes and the topics you have trouble understanding.\nTake Fuller Notes\nNotes should be in your own words, brief and clear. They should be tidy and easy to read. Writing notes will help you better than just underlining as you read, since it forces you to rewrite ideas in your own words.\nStudy the Middle\nThe best time to review is soon after you've learned something. You are more likely to remember the material at the beginning and the end of the lesson, so make sure you focus on the middle when you review.\nSleep On It\nStudy before going to bed, unless you are very tired. It's easier to remember material you've just learned after sleeping than after an equal period of daytime activity, because your brain continues to think even after you've fallen asleep.\nCombine Memory and Understanding\nThere are two ways to remember: by memorizing and by understanding. Multiplication tables, telephone numbers, and math formulas are better learned by rote. Ideas are best learned by understanding.\nThe more ways you have to think about an idea, the more meaning it will have; the more meaningful the learning, the better you can remember it. Pay attention to similarities in ideas and concepts, and then try to understand how they fit in with things you already know. Never be satisfied with anything less than a completely clear understanding of what you are reading. If you are not able to follow the thought, go back to the place where you first got confused and try again.\nQuestion: You can notice your mistakes by   _  .\nOptions: A: saying things out aloud\nB: taking notes\nC: studying the middle\nD: sleeping on it\n\n### Response: The article talks about reciting, or saying things out loud.

It came from the great river itself.It was part of one of the cries used by men who worked in the ships.When a man called \"By the mark twain!\" he meant that the river was \"two marks deep\" there,that is to say,six feet deep ( \"Twain\" is an old form of the word \"Two\".) Samuel Clemens often heard these words when he was young,and he used them as a pen name all his life.\nDuring his work on the Mississippi he met travelers of all kinds,and this helped him a great deal when he started to write.But the number of travelers became smaller when war started in America in 1861.Many of the great ships on the river stopped work.Samuel left then and went to Nevada with his brother,who was at that time Governor of Nevada.There,near the town of Carson,Samuel became a gold miner,but he never made much money at the time.He soon saw that life in the gold mines was not for him.He also tried writing for the newspapers in Nevada,and this seemed more hopeful.He found that he could write.\nHe went to Europe in 1867 and visited France and Italy.In 1870 he married Olivia Langdon,and two years later he was spending nearly all his time writing.Among his books is his own story (1908).\nHe is now always known as Mark Twain,and many people do not even know that his family name was Clemens.He traveled in America and in England,and went to Oxford in 1907.He was one of the great American writers of the time,and could make his readers laugh--a thing which few writers can do.He died in 1910.\nQuestion: What gave him a great deal when he started writing?\nOptions: A: His poor childhood.\nB: The Mississippi River.\nC: All kinds of travelers he met.\nD: His brother.\n\n### Response: The article tells the story of Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), who used \"Mark Twain\" as his pen name when writing books.

Or that you finished an extra couple of years back at State University?\nMore and more people are turning to an utter deception   like this to land their first job or to move head in their careers. For personnel officers, like most Americans, value degrees from famous schools. A job applicant may have a good education anyway, but he or she assumes that chances of being hired are better with a diploma from a well-known university. Registrars at most well-known colleges say that they deal with dishonest claims like these at the rate of about one per week.\nPersonnel officers do check up on degrees listed on application forms.

Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures.\nDentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth.\nDentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth.\nDentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly.

Now scientists have discovered the same thing happens with the songs of another creature----the humpback whale. The mammals become absorbed by new tunes just like people do, and the most popular original whale songs spread globally like hit singles.\nMale humpback whales are famed for the loud, long and complicated songs they make during the mating season. Each song lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and the males can sing nonstop for 24 hours. At any one time, all the males in a population sing the same song.\nBut a study shows that this song changes over time and spreads around the oceans. Dr. Ellen Garland of Queensland University, said: \"Songs move like cultural communication from one population to another, causing all males to change their song to a new version.\"\nResearchers recorded songs from six neighboring populations of whales in the Pacific over a decade. They found that new versions of the songs appear over time and always spread from west to east. It takes two years for songs that appear in the waters off Australia to be heard in French Polynesia.\nMost of the new songs contain material from the previous year mixed with something new. \" It would be like getting an old Beatles song together with U2,\" she said. \" Occasionally they completely throw the current song out of the window and start singing a completely new song\".\nDr. Garland believes that a small number of whales may migrate to other populations carrying the new songs with them, or that they are heard by passing whales.\nThe researchers suspect whales adopt new songs to make themselves distinct.

The origins of most of the days are unknown. They were certainly not created by individual people. Other days, however, especially those celebrated in western countries, often owe their origins to a particular person. One of the most popular of these, even though it is fairly recent, is Mother's Day. Mothers have always been highly regarded in all cultures. The ancient Romans had a festival known as Hilaria, during which children took presents to the temple of the \"Mother of the Gods\". The Christian Church adopted this idea and called it Mothering Sunday. However, over the years this custom was gradually forgotten and almost disappeared by the end of the 19th century.\nBorn in 1864 in Virginia, USA, Anna Jarvis was a school teacher and believed children should show gratitude to their mothers for all their love and care. Encouraged by a friend, she wrote to thousands of important people--politicians, churchmen, doctors, city officials--and asked them to support her idea: a special day of the year for thanking mothers.\nIn 1910 the Governor of West Virginia introduced Mother's Day into the state. The date chosen was May 10--the second Sunday in May, which is still observed in America today. This date was chosen because May 10 was the date on which in 1908 Anna Jarvis's mother had died. In 1914 President Woodrow Wilson made May 10 the official date for Mother's Day throughout the United States.\nSoon there was a Mother's Day International Association and the custom began to be adopted in many countries of the world.\nAnna Jarvis, a sad and disillusioned  woman, died in 1948. The custom she had worked so hard to establish and which had become almost universal had lost its original purpose. It had been taken over by business.

But at least empty the bucket faster than you fill it with new tasks. Put some space between finishing one thing and starting another. For example, after sending one email, take a breath before replying to another one. Drop the stuff you can no longer afford to lug around. At sea level, you can run with a brick in your backpack, but if you're hiking on a mountain, that brick has to go.\nQuestion: The saint probably wanted to tell the scholar by pouring water into the cup, that   _  .\nOptions: A: he should be diligent in order to succeed\nB: he had already gained enough knowledge\nC: he ought to pay attention to details\nD: he should keep learning every day\n\n### Response: ",

        "output": "The saint used the image of overfilling a cup to explain that the scholar already had enough knowledge. The story suggests that by continuing to study, even if he never learned anything new, this would be doing as much as possible with what he knows and has now; it is also wasting time because there are other opportunities in life besides studying endlessly each day.

He was even more shocked by the reason: He failed to repay thousands of dollars in debt.\nWaldron's identity had been stolen by his father, who left when Randy was learning to walk. From 1982 to 1999, Randy Waldron, Sr., used his son's Social Security number to obtain credit from various merchants and lenders, then racked up tens of thousands of dollars in debts. He declared bankruptcy in his son's name, which resulted in default judgments against the younger Waldron. It has taken Randy Jr., now a 24-year-old flight attendant, years to untangle the mess.\nWaldron isn't alone. Identity theft is this country's fastest-growing crime -- and, increasingly, ID thieves are targeting children. Their clean credit and absence of criminal histories make them ideal victims.\n    Linda Foley, co-executive director of the Identity Theft Resource Center inprefix = st1 /San Diego, estimates that at least 400,000 children had their identities stolen in 2005, more than double the number in 2003. Waldron's case is typical: The resource center estimates that two-thirds of child ID thefts are committed by family members.\n    Some dishonest persons use children's names and Social Security numbers to ring up massive debts; others use children's identities in place of their own when caught committing other crimes; still others sell identification information on the black market to illegal immigrants, fellow criminals or even terrorists. The theft brings its victims enormous financial and emotional trauma, in part because the identity abuse often goes undetected for years.\n    Dealing with child identity theft after it happens is extremely difficult. Laws in many states are insufficient to handle the crime's complexity, and financial institutions are often less than helpful. Randy Waldron, Jr., has worked tirelessly for eight years to straighten out his credit record, and he continues to deal with the fallout. \"It's been a very...\nQuestion: Why do children easily become the targets of identity theft?\nOptions: A: Because they cannot read or write at a young age.\nB: Because they have empty credit and criminal records.\nC: Because they are too young to protect themselves.\nD: Because identity theft can't be found in time.\n\n### Response: The article states that children are becoming more frequent targets of identity theft because they have a clean credit and lack a criminal history.

But degrees in finance, economics and a few other fields often guarantee good jobs.\n\"I have applied to 15 companies online, and most of them show interest in hiring me,\" said WangLi, a postgraduate of labor Economics at Southwest University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. He said that all the students of economics, finance and accounting in his university had received at least two job offers.\nStudents of mining and materials science that were not popular before, however, have observed more employment opportunities than before. The employment rate of graduates from the courses was 100 percent at Guizhou University.\nOn the contrary, some so-called \"hot courses\" including law, journalism and computer science that have received large groups of students, failed them in the job market. Experts said high tuition fee of those courses led to blind enrollment expansion.\nAnother problem which makes it difficult for graduates to find jobs is the gap between school- learned- knowledge and requirements of real career.\nIn 2007, merely 60percent of computer science graduates were employed.

The amount of these chemicals has risen heavily in the past few years, as more areas of the world industrialize and new products are produced. Over 80,000 different chemicals are used in industries world wide. Around the world hundreds of millions of tons of harmful waste are produced each year. Often, it is difficult and expensive to get rid of these chemicals or to store them in a way that does not endanger human life and the environment.\n     Every year, major health problems result from harmful waste. Sadly, it is often when someone has died or, become seriously ill that governments will take action and reduce levels of dumped harmful waste. In 1989, a school inprefix = st1 /New Jerseyhad to be closed because students there had suffered too much exposure to chromium. It was later learned that large amounts of chromium had been dumped nearby and blown over to the school area.\n     Research has been done to provide information on the effects of every chemical. Because waste chemicals often mix together, it will also be necessary to learn how the combinations of these chemicals affect human health.\n   Some governments have realized how serous the problem is and are making laws to get rid of harmful waste. They are also trying to limit the amount of waste industries are allowed to produce.\n   Not only governments but the public as well must form part of the solution. They can choose not to buy those products which require the production of harmful waste, attempt to affect policymakers, and produce less harmful waste themselves.

If so, Judith Rich Harris has good news for you. Parents, she argues, have no important long -term effects on the development of the personality of their children. Far more important are their playground friends and neighborhood. Ms. Harris takes to hitting the assumption, which has dominated  developmental psychology for almost half a century.\nMs. Harris's attack on the developmental psychologists' \"nurture\" argument looks likely to reinforce  doubts that the profession was already having. If parents matter, why is it that two adopted children, brought up in the same home, are no more similar in personality than two adopted children brought up in separate homes? Or that a pair of identical twins, brought up in the same home, are no more alike than a pair of identical twins brought up in different homes?\nDifficult as it is to track the clear effects of parental upbringing, it may be harder to measure the exact influence of the peer  group in childhood and adolescence. Ms. Harris points to how children from immigrant homes soon learn not to speak at school in the way their parents speak. But acquiring a language is surely a skill, rather than a characteristic of the sort developmental psychologists hunt for. Certainly it is different from growing up tensely or relaxed, or from learning to be honest or hard -working or generous. Easy though it may be to prove that parents have little impact on those qualities, it will be hard to prove that peers have vastly more.\nMoreover, mum and dad surely cannot be ignored completely. Young adults may, as Ms. Harris argues, be keen to appear like their peers. But even in those early years, parents have the power to open doors: they may choose the peers with whom their young associate, and pick that influential neighborhood. Moreover, most people suspect that they come to resemble their parents more in middle age. So the balance of influences is probably complicated. Even if...\nQuestion: What does the author mean by saying parents are not completely off the look at the end of the passage?\nOptions: A: Parents should control the situation.\nB: Parents should give their way to children.\nC: Parents should spend more time on children.\nD: Parents should take on their responsibility.\n\n### Response: ",

So while no single factor can be said to shape humans' personalities definitively - including parenting-parents are still very relevant ,so taking on responsibility for their actions would be appropriate here .\n\n\nSo the answer should be D: Parents should take on their responsibility.\" ### D"

So, every day Ms Cheng carries a bag of parcels, letters and documents and does her rounds in North Point. She's a courier .\nFive years ago, Ms Cheng was a nurse at a private clinic. She had worked there for 30 years but became jobless when the doctor moved away. It was difficult for her to find another job as a nurse. \"People do not trust my ability when they learn how old I am,\" she said. After two years of searching, she eventually found another nursing job. But then after two years, she quit. Why?\n\"My colleagues were young and they didn't understand me because of my age. They often asked me, 'You are so old. What are you working for?' I was very unhappy,\" she said. When the rest of her family left for work, she was lonely and bored at home. Then her neighbours told her about Employees' Retraining Board offering retraining courses for older people. These courses are specifically designed to encourage the older people back to work.\n\"I was interested in courier work. I didn't think my age was a barrier  because I was fit,\" she said. Upon graduating, Ms Cheng was offered a job by a company.

It took Ms Cheng 24 hours to make up her mind: there was nothing wrong or embarrassing about doing the job.

It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland. She has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work.\nThe writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much.\nCharles later wrote the story down under the nameAlice's Adventures Under Groundand gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the nameAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems.\nSince the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day.

So, he had to get a job.\nDuring his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay   farm. He threw hay up into wagons as the tractor drove around fields, and then they stacked   it in the hot barn. It was a hot, lowpaying job.\nHe once worked a few nights a week at a grocery store. He put things on the shelf. It was a lot of lifting and carrying, and his arms were strong from this and the previous job. It was dull and didn't pay much.\nHe took some time off when soccer got serious, but the following summer he tried working at a lumber yard.

He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it.\nHe won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the \"behavior\" of molecules  led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the\"building blocks of life\".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell.\nDuring World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948.

A few days later, when they were coughing and sneezing, he gathered 37 more people and divided them into three groups. Group 1 members spent three days and nights in the same room with one of the infected students, separated by a screen so they couldn't touch one another. Group 2 sat around a table while an infected volunteer talked, coughed and sang to them. Group 3 held hands with an infected student for ten seconds, and then touched their own noses or eyes.\nAlthough most scientists at the time, the mid-70s, believed colds were spread by virus-laden droplets spread through the air when infected people coughed or sneezed, Gwaltney suspected physical contact might play an important role. Sure enough, of the 15 people who had touched a student volunteer, 11 became infected--compared with only one of those who had been sitting at the table, and none who had spent three days and nights together.\n\"The best evidence we have is that hand-to-hand contact is the most efficient way of transmitting virus,\" says Gwaltney.

This doesn't sound much, but a 5degC change is the difference between the current warm period and an ice age.\nGlobal warming leads to other changes in the climate: melting ice, more evaporation , changes in geographical patterns of rainfall, heavier downpours separated by longer dry spells, more frequent heat waves, more intense hurricanes, and sea level rise.\nThese changes could affect crop growth as drought, increased evaporation and shrinking glaciers disrupt water supply. Some crops could suffer heat stress. While there may be benefits in some regions, overall climate change is likely to have a negative impact on global food supplies. The impacts of climate change on agriculture will vary widely around the world. A global temperature rise of 1-2 degC is expected to increase food production in some regions, particularly mid-latitude areas. But in tropical regions even a small amount of warming could reduce crop yields. A temperature rise of 3 degC or more could threaten global food resources, as all regions are likely to experience negative impacts overall.\nFreshwater resources could also diminish, especially in tropical regions, as rain patterns change and evaporation speeds up. Some communities could lose essential melt water as glaciers disappear, while more intense rainfall and hurricanes could cause more flooding, leading to water pollution and bacterial diseases such as cholera becoming more widespread.\nClimate change could lead to a variety of health impacts - both positive and negative.

But these friendly pubs can be dangerous places of potential gaffes  for the newcomers.\nA team of researchers have discovered some of the unknown customs of British pubs-starting with the difficulty of getting a drink. Most pubs have no waiters-you have to go to the bar to buy drinks. A group of Italian youths were waiting 45 minutes before they realized they would have to fetch their own. This may sound inconvenient, but there is a hidden purpose.\nPub culture is designed to promote sociability in a society known for its reserve. Standing at the bar for service allows you to chat with others waiting to be served. The bar counter is possibly the only site in the British Isles in which friendly conversation with strangers is considered entirely suitable and really quite normal behavior. \"If you haven't been to a pub, you haven't been to Britain.\" This tip can be found in a booklet, Passport to the Pub: The Tourists' Guide to Pub Etiquette, a customers' rule of conduct for those wanting to sample \"a central part of British life and culture\".\nThe trouble is that if you do not follow the local rules, the experience may fall flat.

Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely. It helps to cut these lofty long-term goals into smaller chunks. To encourage weight loss, you can slowly cut back on your calorie intake or increase your exercise regimen each week. Whatever route you take, setting those little goals will help you achieve the big ones faster.\nThink of the things you've gained by being patient.

Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity  , the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to agree with a stereotype, a US study says.\nBoys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to agree with the \"boy code\"of hiding their emotions to be a \"real man\".\nThe report, presented at a conference of the International Boys'Schools Coalition in London attended by the heads of private and state schools, goes against _ that boys do better when taught alongside girls. Tony little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.\nThe research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their females peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills. But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boy's learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia. Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with \"boy-focused\"approaches such as themes and characters that interest them. Because boys generally have more acute(sharp)vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given \"hands-on\"lessons where they are allowed to walk around. \"Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern type in which violence and sexism are major themes\" James wrote.\nSingle-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to agree with a stereotype that men...\nQuestion: According to Abigail James's report, which of the following is characteristic of boys?\nOptions: A: They enjoy being in charge and master\nB: They love to be greatly encouraged\nC: They are violent and sexist\nD: They have sharper vision\n\n### Response: In the report, James writes that boys generally have more acute vision.

This means that all vehicles such as cars, trains, buses, planes and ships that need oil to work will not be able to run. So it will be necessary to develop a new system of transport which uses a fuel more than oil. Electric vehicles are one possibility. In Britain, most families have at least one car and this car is used every day. It could be that only one person in the family drives the car to work or for shopping. The number of cars on the road which are almost empty perhaps helps to explain why the oil is used up so quickly. The family car is a very useful form of transport but it is also a great waste of energy, especially if it is compared with buses or trains. Much petrol is used by a car which is traveling at 120 kilometers an hour. Clearly, it would be better if there were fewer cars on the road and more speed limits so that the oil which is left will last as long as possible.\nAbout 25% of Britain's total consumption of energy is _ --it is used only in the home. Just over 20% is used for transport. Most of the energy is used in industry. It is difficult to suggest any possible energy conservation in industry because many of the suggestions would mean that some people would lose their jobs. It is important that industry produces the same amount of products using the same amount of workers.\nObviously, conservation is not going to be the answer to the energy crisis . The most it can do is to give more time for a better solution to be found. The more time which is available for new sources of energy to be developed, the better it is because there is still a lot of work to be done in order to find suitable, safe methods of producing energy.\nQuestion: Which of the following is true?\nOptions: A: Compared with buses and trains, the family car is useful and can save energy.\nB: A car driving at the speed of 80 kilometers per hour uses half as much petrol as a car traveling at 160 kilometers per hour.\nC: It is possible for people to develop vehicles.\nD: Limitation of the number of cars on the road and their speed will help the oil last longer.\n\n### Response: The oil resources which are left will not last very long.

The problem is within that person's mind. Controlling guns will not control killing. Changing the mindset will, however.\n--- Bobby Walker, U.S.\nGuns are deadly to all others who are near or know someone who has one. People don't understand the danger it holds, and don't realize what will happen just by cleaning it of if a younger child gets a hold of it. This weapon  is dangerous and we don't need teens, kids, anyone to have them. Society can get along without guns.\n---Ann Miller, U.S\nI have a very large farm near Austin, Texas, USA.

You ask if I would shoot--of course--that's why I carry a gun.\n--- Texas Rancher, U.S\nSome people think guns are very bad because they lead to violence. In my opinion, when people kill themselves or others, they do not have any feelings because they do not know anything about love, sympathy , and promise. The only way those persons can get these feelings is when they keep close to family, friends and people who matter to them.

He was most well-known for his brushwork and the way in which he connected with the human soul. His life, however, was not happy.\nHe was born on July 15,1606 in Leiden, the Netherlands. His father wanted him to have a real, learned profession but Rembrandt left the University of Leiden after becoming bored. He began studying art under a local teacher but soon left and studied in Amsterdam where he mastered all his lessons in six months!\nAt the age of 22, he moved back to Leiden and began to get his own students. One of his students was the famous artist Gerrit Dou. In 1631 he returned to Amsterdam where he became the most popular portrait painter in Holland. Rembrandt met Saskia and married her in 1634. She was a cousin of a very successful art dealer and she helped him to meet wealhy people who commissioned  many paintings from him. He used her as a model in many of his paintings.\nRembrandt's private life, however, was very unfortunate. He had four children with Saskia but only one, Titus, survived. Saskia died in 1642 at the age of only 30. In 1649, his housekeeper became his second wife and was also a model for many of his paintings.

She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.\nWhen Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration.

And I think 'American' cuisine is moving in the same direction, becoming more localized, not globalized. \"\nAmerican cuisine is shaped by the natural wealth of the country. Having never faced agricultural hardship, Americans don't have to rely on rotating crops, such as the Japanese, whose food culture now showcases buckwheat   alongside rice, or the Indians, or the French and Italians, who feature beans alongside wheat. \"That kind of negotiation with the land forced people to incorporate  those crops in to the culture,\" says Barber. And so eating soba noodles becomes part of what it means to be Japanese, and eating beans becomes part of what it means to be French.\nSo if what we eat is what we are, what are Americans? Well, meat. \"If Americans have any unifying food identity, I would say we are a mostly white meat culture,\" says Barber. \"The protein-centric dinner plate, whether you're talking about a boneless chicken breast, or a 16-ounce steak, as an everyday expectation is something that America really created, and now exports to the rest of the world.\"\nEvery single culture and religion uses food as part of their celebrations, says Ellen Gustafson, co-founder of the FEED Project and The 30 Project, which aims to deal with both hunger and overweight issues globally. \"The celebratory nature of food is universal.

Mr. Smith felt very sorry for this poor boy, and determined to tell his son Bobby to share his new sledge with the boy. \nBut before he could catch Bobby to speak to him, he was somewhat surprised -- and much more delighted -- to notice that several of the older boys in the park were already offering the poor boy their nice sledges. Mr. Smith watched them with greater interest -- and suddenly realized that the bigger boys were not doing this because they felt sorry for the poor boy, but because they enjoyed riding on his cardboard box more than on their own sledges. They were actually waiting eagerly and impatiently for a turn on the flattened cardboard box!\nQuestion: What did Mr. Smith notice shortly after arriving at the park?\nOptions: A: Some boys were waiting for their turns to slide patiently.\nB: A poor boy didn't have a sledge but a flattened cardboard box.\nC: A big boy was sliding down the slope on a sledge at great speed.\nD: Many boys offered to share their own sledges with each other.\n\n### Response: The article describes a snowy day when Mr. Smith takes his son Bobby to the park with their sledge. When they arrive, there are already lots of boys in the park using sledges, but also one boy who is sliding down on a flattened cardboard box instead of a sledge. The answer must",

Many owners added a second floor or even more floors to their houses, especially in buildings near main streets, in order to rent more apartments and make more money.\nZhang, the historian, said that to better protect the hutong, the government should offer more compensation to residents willing to move away.

In the past two decades, eating habits have changed as people pay more attention to their health.

I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My brothers and sisters and cousins, when I told of the bargain I had made, said I had given four times as much as the whistle was worth.

A short time ago, however, I witnessed an event that showed me how being wrapped up in my own little world has kept me from being fully aware of the bigger world picture around me.\nI was driving to a business appointment and, as usual, I was planning in my mind what I was going to say. I came to a very busy crossroads where the stoplight had just turned red. \"All right,\" I thought to myself, \"I can beat the next light if I race ahead of the pack .\"My mind and car were in auto pilot, ready to go when suddenly my trance was broken by an unforgettable sight. A young couple, both blind, were walking arm-in-arm across this busy crossroads with cars whizzing by in every direction. The man was holding the hand of a little boy , while the woman was clutching a baby sling to her chest, obviously carrying a child. Each of them had a white cane extended, searching for clues to navigate them across the crossroads.\nInitially I was moved. They were overcoming what I felt was one of the most feared handicaps-blindness. \"Wouldn't it be terrible to be blind?\" I thought. Without realizing the danger they were in, they were walking right the path of oncoming cars. I was frightened for them because I didn't know if the other drivers understood what was happening.\nAs I watched from the front line of traffic (I had the best seat in the house), I saw a miracle unfold before my eyes. Every car in every direction came to a simultaneous stop. I never heard the screech of brakes or even the peep of a car horn. Nobody even yelled, \"Get out of the way!\" Everything froze.

Three-D printers are used to make everything from automobile parts to bone replacements for human patients. American research scientists are now working on creating replacements for living tissue.\nResearchers at the Medical University of South Carolina have been working on creating and manufacturing living tissue since 2003.This process is called biofabrication   . It requires special printing equipment and a special kind of ink.\nTraditional printers require ink to produce an image or design on a piece of paper. For their three-D printer, the South Carolina researchers prepare complex nutritious solutions they call bio-inks. Bio-inks are made of proteins and glucose   , which normally provides energy for most cells of the body. The researchers also add living cells taken from the animal that will receive the new, printed tissue. The bio-inks are then added to a device that researchers call the Palmetto bio-printer.\nSarah Grace Dennis is one of the researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina. She says new technology, like the Palmetto bio-printer, is a great help to the biofabrication process.\nThe bio-inks are placed in three dispensers   , containers, inside the printer. Lasers control both the position of the printing surface and the places where the bio-ink is released.\nMichael Yost is a leader of the research team. He says the printing process is fully automated-- machine-operated. He says that the Palmetto bio-printer makes it possible to create complex tissue types.\nThe researchers say bio-printing is still experimental. But they hope in a few years they may be able to print tissue to replace damaged human organs.\nBut there are still some problems which need to be solved.

In much of the United States, winter means the return of snow.\nSnow is a form of frozen water. It contains many groups of tiny ice particles ( ) called snow crystals ( ) . These crystals grow from water particles in cold clouds. They usually grow around a piece of dust. All snow crystals have six sides, but they grow in different shapes. The shape depends mainly on the temperature and water levels in the air. The shape of a snow crystal may change from one form to another as the crystal passes through levels of air with different temperatures. Snow contains much less water than rain. About seventy-five centimeters of snow has as much water as two and one-half centimeters of rain.\nGenerally, the color1 of snow and ice appears white. This is because the light we see from the sun is white. Most natural materials take in some sunlight. However, when light travels from air to snow, some light is sent back, or reflected ( ). Snow crystals have many surfaces to reflect sunlight. It is this light that gives snow its white color1.\nMuch of the water we use comes from snow. Melting snow gives water to rivers and crops. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from cold. Fresh snow is made largely of air which is kept among the snow crystals. Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is greatly reduced. However, snow is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people in the United States every year. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads that are covered with snow or ice.\nQuestion: How can snow protect plants from the cold?\nOptions: A: It gives them much heat.\nB: It has a higher temperature.\nC: It keeps them from wind.\nD: It contains air which helps hold heat.\n\n### Response: The question is asking how snow can protect plants from the cold. The last paragraph (before the question) states that \"Fresh snow is made largely of air which is kept among the snow crystals.\" It also says, \"...the movement of heat is greatly reduced... [and] ... It contains air which helps hold heat.\"\nBased on these statements in combination with an understanding that fresh and fluffy snows have a higher R value than most other building materials, one could conclude that new snow protects plants by helping to trap warmth around them.

Even if you do nothing about it, your bad mood  will probably go away after some time. But with a little effort, you can forget it much faster, often within a day or two.\nWalk it off\nExercise is the most popular bad-mood buster. A person who's in a bad mood has low energy and high tension. Taking a fast ten-minute walk, or taking some quick exercise can do wonders towards changing that bad mood.\nTune it out\nListening to your favorite music for a while can also make tensions go away quickly, because music starts associations with past positive experiences we've had.\nGive yourself a pep talk\nStop and listen to what's on your mind. Bad moods are often started by too many negative thoughts. Write them all down on paper, including the pessimistic messages you've been giving yourself and then give optimistic answers.(\"I still don't have a job.\" Vs\" I have two interviews next week.\")\nReduce your stress\nRelaxation techniques are wonderful mood-lifters. There include de3ep breathing, stretching and visualizing, all of which sound complicated but aren't. One easy way to visualize, close your eyes and picture a favorite place, such as the beach. Another simple way to unhappiness is to make a to-do list. One reason for being in a bad mood is feeling you have no options. By taking control over certain areas, you realize you're not helpless. You can make changes in your mood and life.\nAvoid things that won't improve your mood\nTV may not help much: you need to increase your energy level and stimulate your mind-something that the TV show \"Neighbors\" won't do. And before you reach for that piece of cake and coffee, think about how mood and food are linked. Sugar and caffeine contribute to depressed moods. The better choice?

Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink.\n    The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol.\nIn this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk.\n    Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\"\n    \"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\"\n    Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\"\n    \"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\"\n    The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers.\n    A statement said, \"This shows that the government needs to focus more attention on increasing the price of alcohol, and increasing education and national campaigns for both young people and their families on the dangers of alcohol.\"\nQuestion: Who should be responsible for the fact that some teenagers formed the habit of drinking besides their parents and friends, according to Don Shenker?\nOptions: A: Their teachers.\nB: Governments.\nC: Supermarkets.\nD: Themselves.\n\n### Response: ",

But sadly, hiring someone to take care of them when you're going to work is getting more expensive by the year.\nEarlier this month it was reported, that the cost of involving an infant or small kid at a childcare centre rose 3 percent in 2012, faster than the general cost of living. There are now large strips of the country where daycare   for an infant costs more than 10% of the average married couples' income.\nThis is not necessarily a new trend, but it is somewhat puzzling me. The price of professional childcare has been rising since the 1980s. Yet during that time, pay for professional childcare workers has stood still. Actually caregivers   earn less today than they did in 1990. Considering that labor costs are responsible for about 80% of a daycare center's expenses, one would infer that stable wages means stable prices.\nSo who is to blame for higher child care costs?\nChildcare is a carefully regulated industry. States lay down rules about how many children each employee is allowed to watch over, the space care centers need per child, and other details. And the stricter the regulations are, the higher the costs will be. In Massachusetts, where childcare centers must hire one teacher for every three infants, the price of care averaged more than $ 16,000 per year. In Mississippi, where centers must hire one teacher for every five infants, the price of care averaged less than $5,000.\nUnfortunately I don't have all the daycare center regulations, but I wouldn't be surprised if as the rules have become more complicated, prices have risen. The tradeoff   might be worth it in certain cases; after all, the health and safety of children should probably come before cheap service. But certainly, it doesn't seem to be an accident that some of the cheapest daycare available is in the least regulated South.\nQuestion: What does the author feel puzzled about?\nOptions: A: Why the prices of child care vary greatly from state to state.\nB: Why increased child care prices have not led to better service.\nC: Why childcare workers' pay has not increased with the rising childcare costs\nD: Why there is a severe shortage of childcare professionals in a number of states.\n\n### Response: The author is puzzled by the fact that childcare workers' pay has remained stagnant during a period of rising prices for childcare. The article explains that 8",

While there are other possible explanations related to government regulation or supply shortages, they do not relate directly with the situation described in the article because states regulate different aspects of child care, such as number of children per employee or square footage available per child; it's unclear how these regulations might affect wages since both could be expected to raise cost without addressing each other[2].\nSo C is clearly correct answer here!\n\n  [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Day_Care# ### C"

I woke up a few hours before sunrise, drove through the darkness and out of the city, hiked for 30 minutes to the top of a hill overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, and snapped  this photo. As I stood there soaking in the early morning light, I was reminded of an important lesson.\nWhen I arrived in San Francisco, I told myself, \"Just take photos as you do other things.\" My primary goal was to meet with friends and so I figured I could take pictures as we walked around the city. This resulted in exactly zero photos worth sharing. I had vague ideas like, \"I'd like to do some street photography,\" but I never went out with the intent of photographing something specific. Finally, on the last morning, I went out with the intent of capturing a specific picture and I ended up with something worth sharing. My mistake was that I assumed that because I wanted to take photos, I would end up getting a desirable result.\nHow often do you do this in your own life? We go to the gym to \"work out\" without trying to become better at something specific. We wish that we were more creative, but never work on a particular project. When you commit to a task, however, then the next step is obvious. You want to take a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge at sunrise? Next step: find a good spot. You've found a good spot?

The narrator says that they went to San Francisco with the intent of taking pictures, but ended up without any photos worth sharing because their focus was too vague (street photography).

It is extremely hard sometimes to say a simple thing like \"I was wrong about that, \"and it is even harder to say, \"I was wrong, and you were right about that. \"\nI had an experience recently with someone admitting to me that he had made a mistake fifteen years ago. He told me he had been the manager of a certain grocery store in the neighborhood where I grew up, and he asked me if I remembered the egg cartons  . Then he related an incident and I began to remember clearly the incident he was describing.\nI was about eight years old at the time, and I had gone into the store with my mother to do the weekly grocery shopping. On that particular day, I must have found my way to the dairy food department where the incident took place.\nThere must have been a special sale on eggs that day because there was an impressive display of eggs in dozen and half-dozen cartons. The cartons were stacked three or four feet high. I must have stopped in front of a display to admire the stacks. Just then a woman came by pushing her grocery cart and knocked off the stacks of cartons. For some reason, I decided it was up to me to put the display back together, so I went to work.\nThe Manager heard the noise and came rushing over to see what had happened. When he appeared, I was on my knees inspecting (examining)some of the cartons to see if any of the eggs were broken, but to him it looked as though I was the criminal. He severely scolded me and wanted me to pay for any broken eggs. I protested my innocence and tried to explain, but it did no good.

She simply began baking.\nMy Grandmother turned 94 last week and this I believe is her secret to life. My grandmother is generous and hard-working in a way that is rare for our time.

The program is a new concept that has developed a wide variety of students' abilities and excited their interest in education and self-directed learning. They are a group of students that , instead of being educated through the normal school courses, have created their own subjects and project-based interactive learning.\nThe students are almost completely independent. They choose a goal that they want to accomplish and work on for the whole year. These goals have included some impressive attempts such as writing a novel, writing a play , learning the piano and more. Along with these larger attempts , the students meet every day to ask questions about other subjects like natural sciences , social sciences, etc. Although most of them say that they don't like math, they did eventually develop an interest in math through this independent learning technique.\nThe education program, which has attracted a huge variety of students, allows the students to learn and develop research skills and questioning techniques and allows them to truly be interested in the subjects they are diving into . They also teach each other what they have learned , which allows them to develop different way of presenting and gathering material that they have researched.\nI wish that I could have participated in such a project during my high school career, like writing a novel.

Nowadays, they also live in Atlantic waters off the East Coast of the United States. These lionfish are what scientists call an invasive  species  or an \"alien invader.\" \nLocal divers off the coast of North Carolina were not expecting to see what they found one day in August 2002--the beautiful lionfish, common to the warm waters of the western Pacific, but unknown of the Carolina coast. They provided the first solid evidence that lionfish were in the Atlantic. \nA year later, scientists documented 19 lionfish sightings at eight locations along the North Carolina continental shelf. Then, lionfish were observed off the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and even as far north as Long Island, New York! Between 2000 and 2003, lionfish sightings were reported at 16 different shipwrecks and natural hard bottom locations. During a summer 2004 research expedition, NOAA(The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists collected 155 lionfish at 19 different locations off the North Carolina coast alone. The jump in numbers and distributions over such a short time strongly indicates that the lionfish is reproducing in the Atlantic Ocean. If this is true, it's the first time that a western Pacific fish has populated the U.S. Atlantic coast.\nThese lionfish were likely released on purpose when people no longer wanted them! The swift and warm Gulf Stream, which transported the floating lionfish eggs from Florida northward, helped the lionfish's Atlantic journey. In Florida waters and along the continental shelf near the Gulf Stream the temperatures are very similar to the lionfish's native waters. \nHowever, from north Florida upward, the waters along the coastline are too cold in the winter for lionfish to survive. Scientists expect them to survive the winter only at water depths greater than 120ft because this is where the Gulf Stream has influence all year long.

In fact, we are advised to drink water before we feel thirsty.\nThese doctors think that health problems such as headaches, high blood pressure and asthma could be helped if people drink more water. They also believe that drinking more water can help people who are overweight. Water contains no calories so it will not make us put on weight. If we drink water, we will probably drink less sugary soft drinks such as Coca-cola. Doctors also believe that drinking more water may stop people from overeating.

After high school, Lin sent his resume  and a DVD of highlights to all the Ivy League schools, and his dream schools Stanford and UCLA. Harvard and Brown were the only schools that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships.\nAfter graduating from Harvard University, Lin went undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft . Lin spent his first season with his hometown the Golden State Warriors. He saw limited minutes with the Warriors, but was cheered in arenas  around the country, particularly in cities with large Asian communities, as fans came out in crowds to cheer their homegrown star. In late 2011, Lin spent less than two weeks with the Houston Rockets, moving to the New York Knicks at the very end of the year.\nHe has made several trips to the NBA's Development League, a minor league for players who show promise but need seasoning before they can compete at the highest level. It appears to have paid off. In February 2012, after keying the Knicks victory over New Jersey, Lin was named the starter for the Utah game, a position he appears to have a hold on in the short term, as Baron Davis, who signed in December to play the position, stays on the disabled list.

Maybe running around the playground or jumping rope for hours would bring you pleasure. At that time you weren't thinking of health, you were just thinking of entertainment . But in this age of high-tech home equipment, the simple joy of jumping rope has been forgotten. I think rediscovering it probably will give you a total-body exercise.\nAlthough considered an excellent form of exercise, jumping rope has never been widely accepted because of two reasons. First, most people consider jumping rope to be an excellent form of cardiovascular   exercise, but they also believe that it is simply too difficult. In other words, they don't think they'll be able to continue jumping for the near 20 minutes in order to achieve a beneficial physical effect. Second, many  people regard it as a little boring and overly repetitive --not as something fun or enjoyable.\n _ . Instead of doing the usual two-foot bounce  over and over again, players good at rope-jumping often change their pattern every 10 or 20 jumps. A single bounce, a double -bounce, a skip, a knee-up, side swings, as well as a variety of other easy-to-learn free-style rope-jumping .\nNowadays researchers are discovering that jumping rope also prepares the brain for learning.

Thus, a person has to work more hours to pay for the same thing.\nFor example, let's say that this year a loaf of bread costs $1.00 and average salary in the United Sates is $10.00 per hour. That means a person could earn enough money to buy a loaf of bread in one-tenth of an hour, or six minutes. Then, halfway through the year, the price of the bread goes up to $1.25, while salary stay the same. That means that a person now has to work one-eighth of an hour--seven and a half minutes to buy the same loaf of bread.\nNow let's say that at the end of the year, salary go up to $11.00 per hour, but the price of bread goes up to $1.50. Now a person has to work more than one-seventh of an hour--over eight minutes--to buy loaves of bread, employees will have less money left over to buy other things, Inflation means that the same money buys fewer things and everybody's standard of living goes down, even if salaries are going up.\nSome kinds of inflation are worse than others. Moderate inflation does not distort  relative prices or incomes seriously. Galloping inflation happens rapidly, say at a rate of 100percent or more within a year. And then there's hyperinflation--inflation so serious that people try to get rid of their currency before prices rise further and make the money worthless.

But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe.\nPrevious studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \"moderate\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure.\nThe authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure.

Also, the second generation is losing their identity. Especially in America, there are many immigrants that came from different countries to succeed in the States.  Because they suffer in lots of areas such as getting a job and trying to speak English, they want their children to speak English, not only at school, but also at home in order to be more successful. Because of this situation, their children are losing their identity and, even more, they are ignoring their parents whose English is not very good.\nI think most immigrants are trying to preserve their native language in their new country, but this doesn't help very much in getting a good job.

This means that the plant has changed something in its \"body\" or \"habits\" to make it easier to survive in difficult conditions. There are several conditions they have had to adapted to. First, the soil of the forest floor is shallow. Also, the soil of the rainforest is not very rich, or easy to grow in. Next is the problem of very heavy rain which continues over a large part of the year. Finally, many plants of the rainforest are food for animals that live there.\nThe biggest problem that rainforest plants have to adapt to is the lack of sunlight in the rainforest's lower levels. Plants have adapted to this problem in several ways. Many plants have very large leaves. The large leaf is helpful because it has a bigger surface area. The bigger surface area a leaf has, the more sunlight it can absorb. The canopy trees  adapt by growing to be 100 feet tall so that their leaves can grab all available sunlight. Other plants called lianas   have adapted by rooting themselves in the soil of the forest floor and growing up the trees until they reach the canopy layer. Still other plants, such as epiphytes, have adapted by growing directly on the trees' trunks and branches in the canopy and understory layers of the rainforest.\nAn adaptation to the large amounts of rainfall that many rainforest plants have is called \"drip tips\". Their leaves are tapered  to a sharp point at the end. This allows water to run off the leaf quickly. There are many other adaptations that rainforest plants have made to their environment. These will be discussed in detail, as we investigate the plants of the rainforest!\nQuestion: How do lianas adapt to the environment in the rainforest?\nOptions: A: They rely on other plants to reach the canopy layer.\nB: They grow under big leaves for protection.\nC: They change their leaf structure constantly.\nD: They grow on other plants' branches.\n\n### Response: The context says lianas adapt by rooting themselves in the soil of the forest floor and growing up the trees until",

The loss of sight and hearing threw him into such sorrow that he tried a few times to put an end to his life. His family, especially his wife, did their best to tend and comfort him and finally he regained the will to live.\nOne hot summer afternoon, he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started all at once. He stood under a large tree to avoid getting wet, but he was struck by the lightning. Witnesses thought he was dead but he woke up 20 minutes later, lying face down in muddy water. He was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes, he could hardly believe what he saw: a tree and a muddy road. When Mrs. Franco came running up to him, shouting to their neighbors to call for help, he could see her and hear her voice for the first time in nearly ten years.\nThe news of James regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread and many doctors came to examine him.

Before her the place belonged to Xue Xiaolu, the director of Finding Mr. Right, which hit Chinese screens early this year.\nWith the box office success of So Young, people are once again turning their nostalgic eyes to youth -- an era of passion and pain, of hope and heartbreak. The reason why youth is such a soft spot for many people is that its intangible nature cannot be truly grasped until it is lost.\n\"It is the period between education and employment, between dependence and independence,\"says Zhang Yiwu, professor of Chinese literature at Peking University.\nBut Jiang Chuling, the writer of So Young, says youth shares many similarities with home. When you leave home, you start missing it. \"I think youth is meaningless for young people. Only when you look back does it acquire a special meaning,\" she says.\nFor Zhang Yueran, 31, who is regarded as one of the country's most promising young novelist, \"heroism in youth\" was a cultural asset of people born in the 1970s, but it was swept away by the materialism that is so common in today's world.\nNostalgia for the post-1980s and post-1990s generation, according to Zhang Yiwu, comes from their frustration and anxiety. Born into the most affluent society in 100 years, this generation of single children is not as tough as their predecessors.\n\"They have very high expectations toward life and their disappointment and frustration with reality is huge,\" says Zhang. \"So they turn to the past for comfort, even though they are still young. \"\nSo Young tells a love story set in the 80s and 90s. The idea of reflecting about past time has helped the film win a lot of appreciation. One audience member said, \"I think the story can really bring back memories for a lot of people.

But according to a psychology study by Dr. Richard Wiseman, there's one thing that'll greatly increase your odds of being reunited with a lost wallet: a photograph of a cute baby.\nIn the study, hundreds of wallets were scattered  around the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland. The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers' licenses inside--but more than that, they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger.\nTo finish this, they included personal things in most of the wallets: some included a photo of a happy elderly couple, some contained a cute puppy, some contained a family portrait, and some held a photo of a lovely baby. Others had receipts  showing that the wallet's owner had recently donated to a charity . Some contained no personal details.\nAs the psychologists soon discovered, the sight of a smiling baby is enough to warm nearly any heart: only one in ten of the strangers who _ such wallets did not return them. In contrast, the second most successful image, the puppy, had a 53% return rate. When the wallet included no photograph, it stood only a one in seven chance of being returned to the owner.\nThe success of the baby photograph shows a human compassion  for the young that's been passed down through the ages, according to Dr. Wiseman. \"The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people, which is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective ,\" he told theTimes.\nTo ensure our species' survival, scientists think that we must feel empathy and compassion for our young. Scientists say that this study supports the argument that we won't feel compassion only for our own babies, but for any that we see--hence, the strong desire a stranger...\nQuestion: Why did people return a wallet with a photograph of a cute baby in it?\nOptions: A: Because the wallet was not attractive enough to keep.\nB: Because the sight of a baby could cause a caring feeling in them.\nC: Because they were curious to know the parents of the baby\nD: Because the sight of a cute baby reminded them of their own children.\n\n### Response: The article in this question explores a scientific study into the behavior of humans when presented with an opportunity to help someone.

Online schools receive the same amount of funding as all other public schools, even though they don't have to pay for rent or school equipment. States should use their educational funds to improve education at real schools, not to support online programs.\nSome students only use online classes to supplement their school work. They benefit from the social experience of a traditional high school, while still taking online courses.\nHowever, about 90 thousand students in America receive their education only from online schools. 50 thousand of these students take courses at Florida Virtual School, the largest online school in the country. While this method of schooling helps students who live in remote regions, most school systems are upset that they are losing more students each year to these online programs.\nAlthough online learning allows children to work at their own pace, these online schools have only one teacher per several hundred students. Often, teachers can't give struggling students the help they need as they are unable to talk face-to-face with them, to find exactly what they're having difficulty with.\nAdditionally, even though online schooling accommodates   students who live in more remote states, students in online programs may suffer in social situations because they will not learn valuable communication skills from their schooling. Similar to students who are home schooled, those who take only online classes won't learn social etiquette  , and will be treated differently by their peers.\nOnline schooling might be useful for places where there are not enough students for a real school, such as agricultural regions, but states should only spend taxpayers' money on online schools in extreme cases.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly about?\nOptions: A: Whether students should study at online schools.\nB: Whether online schools should be allowed to exist.\nC: Whether taxpayers should pay for online schools.\nD: Whether traditional schools should be replaced.\n\n### Response: The passage mainly talks about the funding for online schools and whether taxpayers' money should be used to support them.\n",

At first glance it does not look like much. It is a woman's shoe of a style popular in the 1890s. But what is unique  about this shoe is where it was found. It was discovered on the Checkout Pass, the famous trail used by the people seeking gold in Alaska. Who it belonged to or why it was left there is not known. Was it perhaps dropped by accident as the woman climbed up the 1500 stairs carved outface? Or did she throw away goods that she didn't need in order to travel lighter?\nOver 100, 000 people with \"gold fever\" made this trip hoping to become millionaires. Few of them understood that on their way they would have to cross a harsh wildness. Unprepared for such a dangerous journey, many died of starvation and exposure to the cold weather.\nThe Canadian government finally started requiring the gold seekers to bring one ton of supplies with them. This was thought to be enough for a person to survive for one year. They would carry their supplies in backpacks  each weighing up to fifty pounds; it usually took at least 40 trips to get everything to the top and over the pass. Whoever dropped the shoe must have been a brave and determined woman. Perhaps she was successful and made it to Alaska. Perhaps she had to turn back in defeat. No one will ever know for sure, but what we do know is that she took part in one of the greatest adventures in the 19th century.\nQuestion: No matter what happened to the woman who owned the shoe,   _  .\nOptions: A: she must have lived a happy life\nB: she certainly dropped the shoe on purpose\nC: her adventurous spirit is definitely admired\nD: her other shoes were equally fashionable\n\n### Response: ",

The first consideration when purchasing plants is to make reasonably sure that they are suitable for the condition in which they are going to be housed.\nA general rule for most plans being brought indoors for the first time is to ensure that they have reasonable temperature of not less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit,a position out of cold air,safe from pets and not exposed to strong sunlight.\nPlants love company. When plants are growing together,they create an atmosphere of damp around themselves which is far more beneficial than hot dry conditions. A group of plants will also present a more pleasing picture and provide an opportunity for a creative arrangement. There is no secret to this. Just rely on your natural feeling for harmony.\nWatering and feeding plants are probably the two areas of care that are the least well understood,but,again,if you follow a few simple rules,your plants should do well. Cold Slightly warm water is therefore the answer. It is usually better to pour water on to the soil on the surface of the pot rather than put the water into the pot holder at the bottom. Avoid giving small amount of water at regular intervals- it is much better to wet the soil right through the pot in one go and then to allow it to dry noticeably before giving it a further watering.\nThe majority of indoor plants will be in active growth from March until October,and during this time,the established ones will benefit from regular feeding. This may mean feeding with a weak liquid fertilizer  at each watering or at intervals of a week or ten days with fertilizer at a standard strength. It is important,however,to ensure that plants are not fed when growth is inactive,when the soil in the pot is dry,or too soon after the plants has been potted up.\nQuestion: What is the best time to feed the plants?\nOptions: A: When the soil is dry.\nB: When their growth is active.\nC: When the temperature is high.\nD: When they have just been planted.\n\n### Response: The article recommends feeding plants during the time when they are in active growth, which is from March until October. This means that option B is correct because \" their\" refers to the plants and their period of active growth is from March until October.\nOption A states that the best time to feed a plant is when its soil is dry; however, there's no mention in the passage about whether or not this would be a good idea at any point throughout the year.

On a personal level, it also helps keep us awake and active. So we can conclude that coffee plays an important role in society by helping to shape its culture through these exchanges of ideas.\n\n\nThis means that D is probably the best answer because if you chose A or B then why would people continue going there for hundreds of years?

We want to call our friends now, even if we'll see them in 10 minutes. The \"now\" culture is one of convenience, and let's face it, convenience can make our lives easier. \nUnfortunately, by gaining convenience, we've lost some of our patience. If you're like me, patience does not come naturally. Here are a few tips I've learned along the way to cultivate more patience in my life:\n     Ask yourself why you're in a hurry. If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community.\nHang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art.\n _ . Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely. It helps to cut these lofty long-term goals into smaller chunks. To encourage weight loss, you can slowly cut back on your calorie intake or increase your exercise regimen each week. Whatever route you take, setting those little goals will help you achieve the big ones faster.\nThink of the things you've gained by being patient. When all else fails, I think of the good things that have happened in my life because I waited. Passing up on a few \"so-so\" job offers last year paved the way for me to land a job I really wanted.

Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nMinsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \"artificial neural  network\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on.\nRobotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality\nHow many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics.

The bar counter is possibly the only site in the British Isles in which friendly conversation with strangers is considered entirely suitable and really quite normal behavior. \"If you haven't been to a pub, you haven't been to Britain.\" This tip can be found in a booklet, Passport to the Pub: The Tourists' Guide to Pub Etiquette, a customers' rule of conduct for those wanting to sample \"a central part of British life and culture\".\nThe trouble is that if you do not follow the local rules, the experience may fall flat. For example, if you are in a big group, it is best if only one or two people go to buy the drinks. Nothing annoys the regular customers and bar staff more than a group of strangers blocking all access to the bar while they chat and hesitate about what to order.\nQuestion: What may be the best title for the passage?\nOptions: A: Manners in British Local Pubs\nB: Self-service Pubs in Britain\nC: British Local Pubs: Special Chat Places\nD: Local Pub Culture in Britain\n\n### Response: The passage is about Britain, pubs and pub culture. The main idea of the article seems to be that an important aspect of British local culture lies in a traditional pub where many people come together for socializing purposes. This is also indicated by the phrase “Pub culture is designed",

The mission went perfectly without incident--at least that's what every one believed.\nHowever, that view has changed since February 22, after NASA released a digital recording of strange music heard by the space travelers.Then as they were re-entering the zone where they could communicate with ground control.One of the astronauts asked if they should report it.In response, Stafford expressed his doubts if anyone would even believe them.But they needn't have worried. When NASA experts listened to the recordings,they thought the strange sounds were radio interference.\nMichael Collins--the Apollo 11 pilot--said that the only reason why he was not shocked upon hearing them was that he had been forewarned by NASA officials.Collins also said that the music stopped as soon as the lunar module landed on the moon.\nSo why did it take NASA over 40 years to release the digital recording of the awful music only after it was featured in a recent television series NASA's Unexplained Files? The US Space Agency says they have not been hiding them.In the press release that accompanies the release of the recording,NASA officials state,\"The Apollo 10 audio clips were uploaded in 2012, but the mission's sound recordings have been available at the National Archives for anyone that wanted to hear them since the early 1970s.\"\nEugene Cernan, Apollo 10's pilot who heard the sounds first,also released a statement saying,\"I don't remember that incident excited me enough to take it seriously.It was probably just radio interference.Had we thought it was something other than that,we would have briefed everyone after the flight.

According to another study , the Gross-functional product development teams, can achieve a great quality and better cost benefits from socializing and interacting with individuals who work for their suppliers.\nThe first, Dr. Bohlmann's study analyzed cross-functional product development teams, which combine together engineers, researchers and business personnel. The point to involve people with various backgrounds was to show that there was a focus on finance, marketing, and also on a design and functionality, right from the start of the product-development process. In addition to all this, this diversity also helped to make communication more effective in order to ensure that all members of the team were socializing and cooperating, and not just working at cross-purposes.\nAs a result, it indicated that \"interactional fairness awareness\" indeed had an effect on a \"cross-functional communication.\" In other words, all the team members who thought that they had been treated well and respected, showed a great increase in their commitment to the success of the project they had been working on in cooperation with other team members, and, in particular, when they realized their project manager or supervisor to be a kind, nice and honest guy.\nAccording to Dr. Bohlmann, the increase in such commitment is very essential and important because it could improve performance that would result in the achievement of team goals. And if Bohlmann's study comes to the conclusion that nice and honest guys are the first to finish, the second research by Dr. Rob Handfleld shows us that cooperating and socializing well with others can give a team, and even a company an edge, when it comes...\nQuestion: The best title for the passage might be   _  .\nOptions: A: Team work is essential and important\nB: How to develop a successful business career\nC: Honest and kind people make better business career\nD: Socializing and cooperating\n\n### Response: Based on the context, this passage is about how being honest and nice to others helps a person achieve success in business.

At the point thetrains turned their freight, mail, and passengers over to steamboats, wagons, and stagecoaches. This meant that wagon freighting, stage coaching, and steam boating did not come to an end when the first train appeared; rather they became supplements or feeders. Each new \"end of track\" became a center for animal drawn or waterborne transportation. The major effect of the railroad was to shorten the distance that had to be covered by the older, slower, and more costly means. Wagon freighters continued operating throughout the 1870's and 1880's and into the 1890's. Although over constantly shrinking routes, and coaches and wagons continued to crisscross the West wherever the rails had not yet been laid. The beginning of a major change was foreshadowed in the later 1860's, when the Union Pacific Railroad at last began to build westward from the Central Plains city of Omaha to meet the Central Pacific Railroad advancing eastward from California through the formidable barrier of the Sierra Nevada. Although President Abraham Lincoln signed the original Pacific Railroad bill in 1862 and a revised, financially much more generous version in 1864, little construction was completed until 1865 on the Central Pacific and 1866 on the Union Pacific. The primary reason was skepticism that a Railroad built through so challenging and thinly settled a stretch of desert, mountain, and semiarid plain could pay a profit. In the words of an economist, this was a case of \"premature enterprise\", where not only the cost of construction but also the very high risk deterred private investment. In discussing the Pacific Railroad bill, the chair of the congressional committee bluntly stated that without government subsidy no one would undertake so unpromising a venture; yet it was a national necessity to link East and West together.\nQuestion: The word \"subsidy\" in line 27 is closest in meaning to  _  .\nOptions: A: persuasion\nB: financing\nC: explanation\nD: penalty\n\n### Response: The word \"subs idy\" in line  27 means financial assistance or support.

Confucius was born in a noble family in the state of Lu. However,his parents were poor. His father died when Confucius was only three  years old. In 527 BC he began his life as a teacher,usually traveling about and teaching the followers that were around him. Confucius worked as an official of the state of Lu. However,he soon left office to travel and teach. In 484 BC he returned to Lu,where he lived until his death.\nLiving in the turbulent period,Confucius believed that people must go back to the principles of the ancient wise men. He therefore lectured to his pupils on the classics and taught them how to behave properly in society. Confucius did not write down the principles of his philosophy. The Analects (<<>> ),a work written by some of his followers,is considered the most faithful source of information about his life and teachings.\nThe teachings of Confucius were practical and moral,rather than religious. He said that man's behavior should be based on five virtues:kindness, uprightness ,decorum ,wisdom and faithfulness .He asked everyone to fulfill their duties carefully toward the state.

Instead, plants produce volatile compounds   ---- chemicals that easily change from a liquid to a gas. A flower's sweet smell, for example, comes from such volatile compounds to attract insects such as bugs and bees.\nPlants can also discover  volatile compounds produced by other plants. A tree under attack by hungry insets, for instance, may give off these chemicals in order to let other trees know about the attack. In response, the other trees may send off their chemicals to keep the bugs away ---- or even chemicals that will attract the bugs' natural enemies.\nNow scientists have created a quick way to understand what plants are saying: a chemical sensor   called an \"electronic nose\". The \"e-nose\" can tell such compounds as plants make. When plants are attacked, scientists say, the e-nose could help quickly decide whether plants are being eaten by insects. But today, the only way to spot such insects is to inspect individual plants by observing them. This is a challenging task for managers of greenhouses, including those that can house thousands of plants. The research team is working with an e-nose that can recognize volatile compounds. Inside the device, 13 sensors chemically react with volatile compounds based on the interactions  , and then the e-nose will give off electronic signals that the scientists can analyze by using computer software.\nTo test the e-nose, the team presented it with healthy leaves from cucumber, pepper and tomato plants, all being common greenhouse crops. Then scientists collected samples of the air around damaged leaves from each type of crop. These plants had been damaged either by insects or by scientists who made holes in the leaves with a hole punch  .\nThe e-nose, it turns out, can identify healthy cucumber, pepper and tomato plants based on the volatile compounds they produce. It could also identify tomato leaves that had been damaged.
