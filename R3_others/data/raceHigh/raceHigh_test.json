Moviegoers eagerly anticipate in the opening of his new pictures. If you're a Hank fan, you don't have to wait much longer. Hank's newest film, Cast Away, opens this winter.\n    Tom Hanks plays Chunk Noland, a FedEx executive who lives by the clock. He carefully plans every minute of both his professional  and personal time. But on his way home for the holidays, the small plane he's in crashes in the Pacific Ocean. Only Noland survives. He ends up alone on a tropical island and begins a battle for survival. In the process, his view of success and life itself change dramatically .\nThis role may be the most physically-challenging of Hank's career. The actor lost 53 pounds for the part. Director Robert Zemeckis shot the first section of the film with Hanks weighing more than 225 pounds. The filming took a break  for a year while Hanks lost weight. To take off the pounds, Hanks ate little and exercised a lot.\nThe movie may surprise some of Hank's fans. It's not an upbeat comedy like Sleepless in Seattle or You're Got Mail. In fact, Hanks spends a large part of the movie not speaking. After all, who is there to talk to when you're alone on an island?\nQuestion: How did Tom Hanks lose so much weight? Because  _  .\nOptions: A: he had no one to talk to\nB: he felt he was too weighty, so he had to\nC: he was alone on an island\nD: he ate little and exercised a lot",

Over half a year ago, Washington was preparing for the biggest day of his young life ---graduating from high school. But on a cloudy day in May, he had a serious car accident. He survived, but his life changed forever. He recently began all-day physical rehabilitation  . He is relearning almost everything, from the names of his best friends to simple physical tasks.\nHis friends and family have given him a lot of support. While Washington lay in a coma in hospital, friends and family filled his room during visits. They celebrated his 18th birthday in July while he was still unconscious.Two days after Thanksgiving, eight friends from high school visited Washington at his home. The friends looked through photos on Facebook, showing them all to Washington. As he sat in his wheelchair, friends asked him to recognize the people in the photos, helping him recover his brain.\nWashington's popularity doesn't come from nowhere. He was determined to become a police officer after college and behaved like a respectable police officer at school.His high school principal  , Eric Markinson, said Washington was always a gentleman. \"He was incredibly gracious   and incredibly helpful,\"he said.\nHis accident has damaged Washington's brain. It has caused his left side, from his face to his feet, to all but shut down. His personality has also changed. The serious police-officer behavior is gone. He laughs a lot and smiles when he sees children, his mom said.\nNow Washington is working hard on all-day rehabilitation. So far, he has made tremendous   improvement, said his therapist Lindsay Sims.\"I try to live as independently as possible,\"Washington said slowly but firmly.\nQuestion: What happened to Delvin Washington last May?\nOptions: A: He started to make improvements in his speech therapy.\nB: He was seriously injured in a car accident.\nC: He graduated from high school with good grades.\nD: He suffered a heart attack and went into a coma.",

The party held in his hospital room on his 18th birthday also suggests that there were no health issues prior to May.\nOn a cloudy day in May, Washington had a serious car accident. He survived but \"his life changed forever.\" This implies that the accident left him with significant injuries which have affected much of his body's functioning and altered his personality. Nothing is mentioned about speech therapy or heart attacks so options A and D can be eliminated as well.

But psychologists say that gallows humor can be an important way to relieve stress.\"Humor makes you feel in control and it can give you that feeling that everything is okay even when it's not,\"says James M.Jones, a psychology professor at the University of Delaware.\nPsychologists say that just because you're laughing doesn't mean you're wasting time. Occasional tease among colleagues, particularly if it is associated with the job, can inspire creativity, departmental cohesiveness  and performance.\n\"There are a lot of stresses out there,\"says Ed Dunkelblau, a psychologist in Chicago.\"Gallows humor is a way of making difficult things a little less difficult.\"\nThis is as long as the humor is used for the right purpose. The main point of it should be inspiring people--not laughing at them. \"Anything that would lift morale  in terms of the company would be good humor,\"says Thierry Guedj, a professor.\nYou want to give your employees and co-workers a sense of belonging, so don't make observations that are aggressive. Most obviously, Dr. Guedj says, don't make comments about people's physical appearance or faith. If you have any doubt about its appropriateness, don't go through with it.\nOr you can take aim at the person that you know won't be offended : yourself. \"If there's going to be a joke or story, it should be you,\"Mr Dunkelblau says.\n\"People with the ability to laugh at themselves can give other people permission to laugh at themselves, too,\"Mr Jones says.\"And if you can laugh at yourself, you feel better about yourself.\"\nQuestion: According to the passage, gallows humor has the following functions EXCEPT  _  .\nOptions: A: leading to a big mistake\nB: reducing pressure\nC: making people more creative\nD: improving performance",

This strangely named vegetable is, however, as _ as an egg. It can be steamed, fried or baked. It can be eaten by itself or combined with meats and other vegetables.\nEggplant was first grown in India during the 5th century B.C. Its popularity soon spread to China and then throughout Asia. Finally, during the Middle Ages the vegetable made its way to Europe. At that time, eggplant was not the shiny purple vegetable most people know today. Instead, it was like a white egg. Due to this egg-like appearance, eggplant got its name. In its early days, the vegetable was so bitter that people often called it a \"mad apple\". This nickname started because people believed its bitterness was bad for one's health. People actually thought eggplant could cause insanity  and cancer.\nFortunately, today people know that eggplant doesn't cause insanity or cancer. In fact, eggplant is so healthy that it may prevent cancer. In addition, the brain and the heart benefit from this supper vegetable. Since it is high in fiber, eggplant can also improve digestion.\nItaly, Turkey, Egypt, China and Japan are the leading growers of eggplant in the world today. Depending on its location, eggplant may be purple, green, orange or yellow-white. And it can be as small as a tomato or as large as a cucumber. Dish diversities  range from simple to complex, with all of them being delicious!\nToday, thousands of people are gathering in Loomis, Calif, for the 23rd annual Loomis Eggplant Festival. The main activity at the festival is eating delicious eggplant dishes. There is plenty more to do and see, though.

But humanitarianism   will not guide policy for long. We liberals need to argue from Europe's self-interest: our continent has the need, the space and the ability to accept people.\nMany European countries are gradually turning into old people's homes. Germany, Italy, Spain and others have some of the lowest birth rates in human history. It is predicted that about one-third of their populations will be aged over 65 in 2050. Germany needs to import at least 350,000 people a year to keep its workforce stable. Suddenly, young ambitious workers are pouring into the country as if called by a genie   with a lamp. No wonder Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, has been more welcoming than David Cameron, British Prime Minister. But all over Europe, carers for old people are already in need. Norway found oil under the seabed but it would have been better off if it had discovered 50,000 nurses there instead.\nMany rightwingers think we have reached our limits. This feeling is widespread. And it's true that Western Europe is one of the most densely populated regions on earth. Indeed, density has long been Europe's unique selling point: with so many people of different nations closely packed together, we have always traded goods and exchanged ideas fast. That's why the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries happened here.\nBut we have plenty more room. Many European cities aren't dense enough. Now east Germany, north-western Spain and gorgeous mountain villages in Italy are losing people. Lots of cities have unused industrial land.\nHumans inhabit a slice of the EU's territory. Only about 2.5 per cent of the EU's land is used for housing, estimates the European Commission. By contrast, a whopping 43 per cent was used for agriculture in 2009, it says. That's too much. We could turn more land into forest or into green landscapes where people can relax and play. Making that transition is feasible because we now use agricultural land...\nQuestion: It can be inferred that   _  .\nOptions: A: nurses are more badly needed than petrol in Europe\nB: liberals always do something for the Europe's benefit\nC: aging problem in Germany is the worst in Europe\nD: Europeans have already made intelligent use of the land",

That's to say, totally, those workers will give up 6.2 million days of vacation, with an average of five days for each worker. For their employers, they feel happy because that is equal to a potential $500 million of 'free' work, which, according to an economist will boost  the output of the economy by about two percent.\nThe report also showed that the main reasons employees give up their remaining annul leave are due to pressures at work and their failing to appreciate that taking a break could make them more productive and, in turn, boost the economy in the long term.\nThe research, done by price comparison website Travel Supermarket, found that more than one in four of those who will give up their remaining holidays (28 percent) will do so due to pressures at work. Bob Atkinson, travel expert for Travel Supermarket said: \"As the economy is not so satisfying, it's no surprise that people are cautious to take all their leave, especially if they feel stressed and uncertainty at work.\" Nine percent of the 2,020 people surveyed also said they would feel guilty about taking the leave because their work would have to be taken care of by their colleagues. A further three percent said they would be concerned about how taking time off would look to their employer, while the same percentage said they did not want to miss anything interesting or beneficial at work in the time they would be away.\nVicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Suppose that there are about 250 working days in a year, getting an extra five 'free' days of work from their employees could in theory boost the output of  the economy by about two percent.

In other words, Westerners tend to put most of their ideas and feelings into words, and then state these ideas and feelings clearly and openly. It is generally considered a good thing to \"get to the point \"and \"say what you mean,\" and it is largely the speaker's responsibility to ensure that his/her message is stated in a way that is clear and easy to understand.\nIn contrast , Chinese people tend to communicate in a way that is more indirect and subtle. They often view direct, explicit communication as unsophisticated or even rude. They are more likely to preserve good feelings and relationships by not saying something that might upset or offend  another person. If a Westerner makes a request and a Chinese person responds by saying something like \"I'll think it over\", the Westerner may assume that there is a good chance that the answer will be \"yes\". In fact, there is a better chance that the implied answer is \"no\".\nOne interesting example of the Western preference for very direct communication can be seen in what Western students are taught about how they should organize their writing. Writers are generally expected to state their point as clearly as possible, generally right at the beginning. Students are taught to begin paragraphs with a \"topic sentence\" that states the point of the paragraph. Also, articles should generally begin with a brief statement of the points to be made -and also conclude with a review of those same points. In contrast, in Chinese writing it is more acceptable to build up to the point rather announcing it right form the start, although it is also acceptable to state the point up front.\nIt is important to note that Westerners are not all equally direct in their communication styles. For example, the direct communication style is more typical of Western men than of Western women. Furthermore, even in Western culture it is generally not considered good to communicate so directly that you hurt other people's...\nQuestion: The passage is developed mainly by  _  .\nOptions: A: showing the effects and then explaining the causes\nB: providing figures to support its main point\nC: describing the changes in space order\nD: giving examples and making comparisons",

He decided to take his daughter along with him. She was only ten years old. This would be her first trip with her father on what he had always been famous for.\nLarry first began diving when he was his daughter's age. Similarly, his father had taken him along on one of his expeditions. Since then, he had never looked back. Larry started out by renting diving suits from the small diving shop just along the shore. He had hated them. They were either too big or too small. Then, there was the instructor. He gave him a short lesson before allowing him into the water with his father. He had made an exception. Larry would never have been able to go down without at least five hours of theory and another similar number of hours on practical lessons with a guide. Children his age were not even allowed to dive.\nAfter the first expedition, Larry's later diving adventures only got better and better. There was never a dull moment. In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank fastened on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures.\nLarry's first expedition without his father was in the Cayman Islands. There were numerous diving spots in the area and Larry was determined to visit all of them. Fortunately for him, a man offered to take him around the different Spots for free. _ The diving spots afforded such a wide array of fish and sea creatures that Larry saw more than thirty varieties of creatures.\nLarry looked at his daughter. She looked as excited as he had been when he was her age. He hoped she would be able to continue the family tradition. Already, she looked like she was much braver than had been then. This was the key to a successful underwater expedition.\nQuestion: Why did Larry have to stay in a cage underwater sometimes?\nOptions: A: To protect himself from danger.\nB: To dive into the deep water.\nC: To admire the underwater view.\nD: To take photo more conveniently.",

Sound familiar? You aren't alone. We all procrastinate   sometimes, especially when it comes to things we aren't really fond of. And while the number of activities we delay doing in any given week varies from person to person, it's fair to say that none of us is super-efficient 100 percent of the time.\nA study revealed that we spend about 218 minutes procrastinating every day, which amounts to 55 days of lost time each year. We might not think these figures particularly worthy of worry, but when we look at the overall impact of procrastination on our lives, _ Not only does this cost financial loss, it also affects peace of mind. And procrastination isn't just a money thief ---- it steals time too. In general, people who continually put things off are unhappier, as well as being less wealthy and healthy.\nSo why do we do it? \"When we avoid taking action, we're really avoiding pain,\" explains psychiatrist   Phil Stutz. For most of us, pain avoidance isn't limited to one situation. It applies to almost anything that's painful. Most of us try our best never to leave a comfort zone. That's why we sacrifice something much more valuable: time. \"Our time on earth is limited,\" Stutz adds. \"Every moment is an opportunity we'll never have again. Procrastinators act as if they have all the time in the world. But deep down, they know they're wasting parts of their life. The trouble is, most of them don't know how to free themselves.\"\nOne way he says we can reach this level of freedom is by overcoming the pain of avoidance using daily visualization  . \"Picture the pain you're avoiding as a black cloud in front of you,\" Stutz says. \"Notice how you're fed up with the ways this pain has held you back in life, and tell yourself that you're determined to conquer it. Then it's time to get through the cloud and to the other side -- where you're...\nQuestion: What's the writing purpose of the passage?\nOptions: A: To analyze the trouble procrastination causes.\nB: To show what contributes to procrastination.\nC: To solve the problems caused by procrastination.\nD: To encourage people to defeat procrastination.",

In fact, the scientific opinion is that it cannot be differentiated in any way from food normally bred animals. The issue is animal welfare,\" EU Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli told reporters.\nFood derived from the offspring of clones presents no such animal welfare issues, and banning its sale and import would be impossible because the origin is untraceable, Dalli said.\n\"Such a prohibition would lead to a ban of imports of any food of animal origin (meat, milk and processed products)from third countries allowing the cloning technique,\" the report said.\n\"We're not going to regulate for the world,\" Dalli added.\nBut animal welfare groups criticized the Commission's decision, saying it had bowed to pressure from third countries.\n\"We do not accept the Commission's position that it would be impossible to enforce a ban that includes the offspring of cloned animals, as (other) meat traceability systems are already in place,\" said Sonja Van Tichelen, director of the Eurogroup for Animals.\nQuestion: Which of the following is the reason for Commission's decision on the ban according to animal welfare groups?\nOptions: A: The origin of food derived from the offspring of clones is Untraceable.\nB: Food from cloned animals is safe.\nC: The issue is for animal welfare.\nD: The pressure comes from third countries.",

Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others.

They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions.

Many children in our country are growing up in the environment which lacks a sense of security and love. They want to get back the love lost in childhood but never catch it.\nOn the one hand, Chinese like saving faces; on the other hand, they want to encourage their children to be aspirants . They often say how hard somebody else is studying, how good their grades are, and what prize they get. This comparison is the worst thing especially when they say it before many people. Each time you compare your children to others, you will only bring them much disappointment and pain.\nParents should knock at the door when they go into the room of their children. They should get permission before they move something of their children. Parents should first communicate with their children and consider their decisions. Parents should respect their children, and consider them as adults. This respect should begin from changing diapers. Before changing diapers for the children, parents should tell them. Children who do not be respected also do not know how to respect others.\nMany parents have high hopes for their children, and force them to the way that they think is right, even if the kids do not fit, or do not like, such as playing the piano or going abroad.

Besides, in decent restaurants, you can always ask for a pair of knife and fork, if you find the chopsticks not helpful enough. The real difference is that in the West, you have your own plate of food, while in China the dishes are placed on the table and everyone shares. If you are being treated to a formal dinner and particularly if the host thinks you're in the country for the first time, he will do the best to give you a taste of many different types of dishes.\nThe meal usually begins with a set of at least four cold dishes, to be followed by the main courses of hot meat and vegetable dishes. Soup then will be served (unless in Guangdong style restaurants) to be followed by staple food ranging from rice, noodles to dumplings. If you wish to have your rice to go with other dishes, you should say so in good time, for most of the Chinese choose to have the staple food at last or have none of them at all.\nPerhaps one of the things that surprise a western visitor most is that some of the Chinese hosts like to put food into the plates of their guests. In formal dinners, there are always \"public\" chopsticks and spoons for this purpose, but some hosts may use their own chopsticks. This is a sign of genuine friendship and politeness.

I would excitedly turn the tap  on and brush the comb carefully. Satisfied that I'd done a good job. I would happily return the comb to Dad. He would smile affectionately  at me and place the comb on his wallet.\nTwo years later. Dad started his own business, which wasn't doing so well. That was when things started to change. Dad didn't come home as early and as much as he used to. Mum and I became mad with him for placing our family in trouble. With time, an uncomfortable silence grew between us.\nAfter my graduation, Dad's business was getting back on track. On my 28th birthday. Dad came home early. As usual I helped him carry his bags into his study.

The idea is not to rid the world of the Canadian teenager -- he would come back down to Earth eventually, after all -- but rather to help jump-start the emerging suborbital spaceflight industry.\nIt would generate a lot of public interest, which would help commercial spaceflight pick up some much-needed momentum, said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California. \"If there's more interest, there are more customers. If there are more customers, there's more technical development. It's a positive feedback loop, and obviously that's good.\"\nSuch missions would return to Earth without completing a full lap around the planet. Instead, the flights would hit the edge of space about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth, experience a few minutes of weightlessness, then re-enter the atmosphere and land back at a spaceport.\nNone of these firms are ready to fly customers yet, but some are getting close. For instance, Virgin Galactic hopes to begin powered test flights of its SpaceShipTwo vehicle later this year, with commercial operations perhaps beginning in 2013 or 2014. It is SpaceShipTwo that reportedly grabbed the attention of Beyonce and Jay-Z.\nVirgin Galactic has collected deposits from nearly 500 customers willing to pay $200,000 for a ride aboard SpaceShipTwo, and both Virgin and XCOR have inked deals to fly scientists and their experiments on research flights. So a suborbital market already exists -- but Shostak is thinking about ways to make it grow.\nA celebrity launch isn't Shostak's only idea. Suborbital firms should also promote their activities aggressively via social media, Shostak said, and they should make sure their spaceships are bristling with cameras both inside and out, to give the public dramatic views of every mission.\nSome observers view commercial suborbital spaceflight as a potentially...\nQuestion: What can we infer from the text?\nOptions: A: SpaceShipTwo will be the first to fly.\nB: Famous people will be the main passengers in the future.\nC: The space trip is still in preparation.\nD: Every space trip will be made into a film.",

College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it?\nSeveral studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families.\nFirst, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \"high price\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs.\nOther factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree.\nAt the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \"subsidize  \" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities.\nThis puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more.\nTherefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \"college in the end.\nQuestion: It can be inferred that in America   _  .\nOptions: A: famous colleges only accept rich students.\nB: famous colleges charge their students more money\nC: the government spends little money on education\nD: families often break the doors of colleges",

At least one: 12-year-old Arturo Veldenegro of Tucson, Arizona, who won the Pima Air& Space Museum's first annual Great Paper Airplane Project Fly-Off in March 2012.\n\" The purpose of the competition is to inspire and draw kids' interest in science and flight,\" says Tim Vimmerstedt, director of the museum.\nAbout 150 kids entered the competition. The young designers learned about how airplanes fly and then set to work designing their own planes.\nArturo designed and built his airplane. When hen was finished, he took his plane to the flight area and let it fly, outdistancing the other competitors in all age groups. At last, Arturo's airplane flew the farthest---more than 75 feet!\nAs the winner, Arturo got to meet with a team of engineers, which took his design and made a bigger one.

He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)  . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic   effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature. However, he was disappointed that his discovery was being carelessly used as a drug for entertainment. Because of his discovery, LSD fans have fondly called him \"The father of LSD\".

How would it feel to lie back in water so thick with salt that it was impossible to sink?              \nFed by the Jordan River and smaller streams, the Dead Sea is the lowest point on the earth's surface, and its water is ten times saltier than the Mediterranean. As evaporation  is its only outlet, salt and other minerals become super-concentrated.\nEarlier this year, I drove down the long, steep hill to realize my dream. The shoreline was a broad area of bare salt-mud, but the water edge was out of sight. It seemed as if somebody had pulled the Dead Sea's plug . Eli Dior, an Israeli official, explained the problem \"The Dead Sea is drying up.

In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant  , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges  went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey. One week later, this dear sweet couple pulled our car all the way to our place and refused to take anything in return, except for us to pay it forward-and we have, and will continue to do it forever.\nQuestion: Knowing that the wagon had broken down, the author  _  .\nOptions: A: called her friend several miles away for help\nB: stopped the car in front of a simple service station\nC: was afraid that they couldn't overcome the difficulty\nD: encouraged her husband and children to be confident",

Being pregnant and stranded out in the cold has made the author worried about herself as well as others' safety so she is afraid of what might happen next since everything seems hopeless right now.\nHence we see that option C is correct where it says \"was afraid\" because according to our analysis above this statement makes sense given the context of article while other options do not match or make any sense considering ### C"

Unexpectedly, they saw an elderly man grasping for breath in the street.They tried to call the police and ambulance service, but their phones were not working, due to network problems.\nBefore the Polish man became unconscious, the children kept him calm while they flagged down  a passing driver. The children used words they had picked up from their Polish classmates to translate the injured man's answers to the driver's questions.Gary,  10, and his six - year - old sister, Lily, stayed with the man while Thymus and Owen, both 11, led the ambulance to the spot where he lay. Soon the man was taken to hospital.\nThe fantastic four children who came to the aid of the elderly man deserve the highest respect for their quick - thinking and courage in an emergency situation.

And the frontline weapon in their campaign is the water meter  . They want us all to have one and one company is seeking powers to make this compulsory.\nThe Government is anxious for us to use less water, too. Elliot Morley, the Environment Minister, says he is impressed by the savings when a meter is installed. In most homes, consumption drops by 20 percent.\nHe also thinks consumers get a good deal from meters. He said, \"Most people would find that they would either be exactly the same or better off with water meters and it is a fairer way of paying for water.\"\nAt present, only 25% of households have meters and most of those are in East Anglia.

Although my house was already full of cats and dogs, I still couldn't resist an occasional visit to the shelter. This time as I was walking down the row of pens full of barking dogs I noticed a small boy looking into one of them.\n He had a malnourished  looking body and a bony face with a big nose sticking out of the middle of it. He was looking at a small, golden dog. Its bony ribs were showing and its thin tail was folded between its legs. It wasn't begging for attention like the other puppies but was hiding in the corner instead. The boy looked up at me with sad eyes and asked what was wrong with it. \"It was probably abused and abandoned\", I said. \"That is why it is so scared.\"\nThe boy immediately turned to an older lady and said, \"Grandma, I want this one.\" The old woman smiled and walked to the front desk to fill out the adoption forms. I followed and asked about the boy. I found out that he'd had a rough start in life too. She had just gotten custody  of him after the state had taken him from his parents. She had hoped getting a dog would make it easier on him. I looked back at him, holding his scared puppy, and said a prayer for them both.\nIt was yesterday. I was driving down the road enjoying a gloriously sunny, spring day. Then in a green front yard I saw the boy. His teenage body was tall and strong. His nose no longer seemed big but fit well into his smiling face. He was throwing a ball to a healthy, happy dog with shining golden hair.

For instance, we used to have hobbies, entertain our friends and be entertained by them, go outside for our amusements. We even used to read books and listen to music occasionally. Now all our free time is regulated by the \"goggle box\". We rush home for our meals to be in time for this or that programme. A sandwich and a glass of beer will do--anything, providing it doesn't interfere with the programme. The monster demands and obtains   silence and attention. If any member of the family dares to open his mouth during a programme, he is quickly silenced.\nWhole generations are growing up addicted to the television. Food is left uneaten, homework undone and sleep is lost. The television is a universal thing that makes people calm. It is now standard practice for mother to keep the children quiet by putting them in the living-room and turning on the set. It doesn't matter what the children will watch--so long as they are quiet.\nTelevision encourages passive enjoyment. We become content with second-hand experiences. It is so easy to sit in our armchairs watching others working. Little by little, television cuts us off from the real world. We get so lazy, we choose to spend a fine day in semi-darkness.

Reading is the basic part of education and a child's reading ability will influence his school success greatly. Learning difficulties, many of which begin from poor reading skills, can damage a school child's confidence and affect his future achievement. Young children are programmed to learn and they can learn better with encouragement. Ten to twenty minutes of reading a day still leaves plenty of time for play.\nMany parents are concerned that learning to read is too challenging a task for a pre-school child, but they should also remember that most children learn to speak by the time they are 3. Learning a language is probably the single most challenging task any individual can undertake, yet children do it without formal instruction, achieving the fluency much better than adult language students.\nThere is a window of opportunity in terms of IQ development, which is most open during a child's early years. A scientific study, carried out by Dr. Peter Huttenlocher at the University of Chicago, showed that the number of connectors, called synapses , between the nerve endings in a newborn baby's brain is similar to the number in the average adult brain. These synapses increase rapidly during early childhood. By 12-24 months a child's brain has about 50% more synapses than the average adult brain. After that the synapses which are not in use begin to atrophy . For most people, from age 16, the number remains steady. It begins to drop again as we move into our golden years. Doing intellectual activities at a young age, such as learning to read, can stimulate and preserve these connectors in the brain resulting in a long-term beneficial effect on IQ development.\nAnother notable study is probably the Milwaukee project. This study took a group of babies, all of whose mothers had low IQs, and gave them special training for seven hours a day, five days a week, until they started first grade. By the age of 6 these children had an average IQ 30...\nQuestion: Why does the author mention the study by Dr. Peter Hutten locher?\nOptions: A: To remove parents' worry.\nB: To explain IQ development.\nC: To explain how a baby's brain works.\nD: To show the parents' wrong ideas.",

The French called the material serge de Nimes, which means \"cloth from Nimes\". The Americans called it denim. Strauss also bought some cloth from Genoa, a town in Italy. To Americans this name sounds like \"jeans\", so they called his pants jeans. The cloth that Strauss used was always blue, so people also called his pants blue jeans and blue denims. Other people called them Levi's. Levi Strauss jeans are some of the best-selling jeans in the world today. They last a long time and are very comfortable.\nQuestion: 56.

He attended Central High School inCleveland. Langston was named Class Poet one year. He published his first short stories while still in high school.\nLangston Hughes struggled with a feeling of loneliness caused by his parents' divorce. He developed a love for reading books as a way to deal with the lack of time his parents spent with him. His love for reading grew into a desire to write. He wanted to reproduce the powerful effect other writers, like Walt Whitman, had made upon him.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1920, Langston moved to Mexico Cityto live with his father for one year.

Active at night, the animal has lived in Colombia and Ecuador for a long time. But the olinguito did not exist in science books before now.\nKristofer Helgen, director at the National Museum in Washington, led the research team that confirmed the existence of the olinguito. It had been mistaken more than a century ago for a look-alike animal -- a similar but larger olingo . Mr. Helgen had been studying olingos in a museum for ten years. At that time. he observed a difference in the size and shape of the heads and teeth. That led him on an effort to prove he was looking at an animal never before described by science.

Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead.\nOne scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, \"I'm dead--take me away.\"\nBut there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead.\nWhat keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, \"Wait--I'm not dead yet.\" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, \"I'm dead,\" and the other set says, \"I'm not dead yet.\"\nOther scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive.\nChoe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says \"Wait-I'm not dead yet\" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says \"I'm dead\" is left. \"It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases  new unique chemicals after death,\" said Choe. When other ants detect the \"dead\" chemical without the \"not dead yet\" chemical, they drag away the body.\nUnderstanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests.\nThe ants' removal behavior is important to the...\nQuestion: Ants judge whether another one is dead or not depending on  _  .\nOptions: A: the sense of taste\nB: the sense of smell\nC: the sense of touch\nD: the sense of sight",

The doctors, one of whom was a close friend of Cousins, said that his chance of survival was approximately 1 in 500. He read about the theory that negative emotions do harm to the body, so he thought that if negative emotions were damaging to health, then positive emotions should improve health.\nFaced with the real possibility of his approaching death, Cousins thought long and hard and eventually did three things completely contrary to medical opinion.\nFirst he began his own research on all of the various drugs he was on. He discovered that his condition was removing Vitamin C from his body and, based on Cousins' personal research, doctors agreed to take him off several of the drugs he was on and inject  him with large doses of this supplement , as Cousins felt this may be his last hope.\nSecondly, Cousins made a decision to check out of the hospital and into a hotel room.

A new study finds, surprisingly, that lower class people are better at reading the emotions of others.\nThe researchers were inspired by observing that, for lower class people, success depends more on how much they can rely on other individuals. For example, if you can't afford to  buy support services, you have to rely on your neighbors or relatives to watch the kids while you're busy.\nOne experiment researched on volunteers who worked at a university: some had graduated from college and others had not. Researchers used the educational level as an indicator for social classes. The volunteers did a test of emotion perception , in which they were instructed to look at pictures of faces and indicate which emotions each face was displaying. People with more education performed worse on the task than people with less education.\nIn another study, university students who were of higher social status had a more difficult time accurately reading the emotions of a stranger.\nThese results suggest that people of upper-class status aren't very good at recognizing the emotions other people are feeling. This is because they remember their upper status and they think they can solve their problems without relying on others.\nIn the third experiment, people were made to feel that they were at a lower social class than they actually were, and they got better at reading emotions.\n\"The differences between upper-class people and lower-class people are not something ingrained ,\" Kraus says. \"It's the cultural environment leading to them.\" This work helps show that the traditional image of the classes is wrong. \"It's not true that a lower-class person, no matter what kind of person, is going to be less intelligent than an upper-class person.

Ever since there has been water and ships there have been pirates. The earliest documented history of pirates dates back to the 13th century in the Mediterranean Sea. Even the famous Roman emperor Julius Caesar was kidnapped   by pirates at one time.\n     Piracy reached its peak in the early l700s, especially in the Caribbean and off the coast of Africa. In the mid-20th-century, most pirates we're common thieves. They used hooks to steal on board commercial ships, and took all that they could find.

Researchers are finding that, if approached the right way, there can actually be an advantage.\nPsychologists classify envy in two ways: negative and positive. With positive envy, you are motivated by another person's success and struggle to follow it. With negative envy, you want to cut the advantaged person down so you look better by comparison. Let's say you feel sufferings of envy after your rival  at another firm gets promoted. Negative envy might drive you to destroy his success, but positive envy would inspire you to work harder and get promoted, too.\nStudies show positive envy can be a great motivator . In a 2011 study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, researchers in the Netherlands conducted a series of experiments with more than 200 university students. Researchers found that when they caused feelings of positive envy----as opposed to admiration or negative envy----in the students, it drove them to want to study more and perform better on a test measuring creativity and intelligence. While admiration may feel better, the researchers found, it doesn't motivate performance like the pain and frustration of envy.\n\"Those painful sufferings of envy are there for an evolutionary  reason,\" says Texas Christian University researcher Sarah E. Hill, \"warning us that someone has something of importance to us.\" Building on this theory, Dr. Hill and others conducted a series of experiments, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, to test whether envy improves attention and memory----the tools needed to copy a rival's steps to success. In one experiment, half of the participants were asked to recall past feelings of envy; the other half weren't. The two groups were then shown mock  interviews of imaginary peers.

That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.\n\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\"\nProf Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger.

For several months, he lived on life support as we were forced to stand by and watch him wither away. ks5u\n    While his friends were out playing baseball, and sleeping in their own beds, my son was in a hospital bed, attached to a machine that kept his heart beating. As a mother, my first reaction after crying was anger, and then I played the bargaining game: \"Take my life for his, Lord. I've lived my life but he still has so much to do.\" People all around me were praying for a heart to become available, but it made me so angry and confused because I knew for that to happen, someone else's child would have to die. How could anyone pray for that?\n    I still remember so clearly the morning we got the call that there was a heart. As we stood in Dustin's hospital room watching them prepare him for surgery, we experienced the true definition of bittersweet. His dad and I realized that at the precise moment we were standing there with so much hope and so much love, another family somewhere was saying goodbye. We knelt down together and cried, and we prayed for them and we thanked them for giving such a selfless gift. To our amazement, just 10 days later, Dustin got to come home for the first time in many months.  He had received a second chance at life. Over the next two years, he got to go to high school, learn to drive and put his brand new heart to good use volunteering at the homeless shelter and helping the elderly.\nDustin's new heart failed him when he was 16. A tragedy, yes, but we have to see it as the miracle it was. We received two precious years with him that we would never have had without organ donation. We have more pictures, more memories and a great satisfaction in knowing that he was able to experience some of the most exciting times and milestones in a teenager's life.

According to a recent study, the more you struggle while you are learning new information, the better you can remember it later.\nThis theory might surprise you. When teachers are presenting new information, they often give students lots of help. But a new study shows this may not be the best way to support learning. \"Don't be too quick to get help when learning something new,\" education expert Manu Kapur told TFK. \"Try to work on it yourself even if it means trying different ways.\"\nKapur came up with the idea that struggling can lead to better learning. Then he tested it out on students in Singapore. He separated students into two groups. In the first group, students were asked to solve math problems with the teacher's help. In the second group, students were asked to solve the same problems by helping one another, instead of getting help from the teacher.\nWith the teacher's help, students in the first group were able to find the correct answers. Students in the second group did not solve the problems correctly. But they did come up with a lot of good ideas. The students were then tested on what they had learned. The group without any help from a teacher scored much higher than the group who had help. Kapur said working to find the answers helped students understand the process, not just the solution.\nKapur's advice for kids is to put a lot of effort into learning something new rather than going to your teacher for help. \"Simply doing a little work or nothing at all won't work,\" says Kapur. \"The struggle needs to be a genuine attempt to figure out or solve a problem in as many ways as possible.\"\nQuestion: When you have doubt on schoolwork, you'd better   _  .\nOptions: A: ask your teacher for help\nB: make it clear by yourself\nC: ask your classmates to help you\nD: ask your parents for help",

The alike fruit flies are the first insects ever cloned, says the Canadian team that created them. The question everyone asks is why anyone would want to clone flies in the first place. She hopes that the insects , which are very easy to experiment with , will help to adjust the cloning process in other animals and even in humans, where the technique is being researched to aid production of therapeutic   stem cells.\nIn cloning, the DNA-containing nucleus of an adult cell is injected into an egg whose own nucleus  has been removed. At the moment, the majority of cloned mice, sheep and other animals die before birth. It is thought this is because the adult DNA is not properly 'reprogrammed'.\nUsing flies, researchers might discover genes that are important for this reprogramming, and that have matches in other animals. That is because it is relatively easy in flies to knock out the function of a single gene and then attempt cloning with these cells, which will test whether that gene is important. If such genes are confirmed, then in theory cloned mammalian embryos  might be grown in selected solutions that change the activity of those genes to improve the technique's success rate. Although some groups have attempted to clone insects before, Lloyd says this is the first time it has been successful. The team used a slight difference on the standard cloning process: they transferred nuclei taken from embryos rather than fully-grown adult cells. They sucked several nuclei (pl)out of developing fly embryos, and injected them into a fertilized  fly egg. From over 800 early attempts, they cloned five adult insects, the group reports in the journal Genetics.\nQuestion: The failure of most cloned animals is due to   _  .\nOptions: A: the difference of other animals' genes\nB: the improper technique of clone\nC: the complex of other animals\nD: the improper rearrange of the adult gene",

New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animal breeding techniques, and has made our life span longer via medical technology.\nWill mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure, the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends on research and development, and the latest surveys show that the united States is continuing to put billions of dollars annually  into such efforts. So while we are running out of some limited resources, we may well find technological substitutes   for many of them through our research programs.\nTherefore, in the final analysis, the three major factors of production (land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology.

Since then it has been transformed into a series of best-selling novels, a TV series, a record album, a computer game and several stage adaptations.\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's success sent the book straight to Number One in the UK Bestseller List and in 1984 Douglas Adams became the youngest author to be awarded a Golden Pan. He won a further two (a rare feat), and was nominated--though not selected - for the first Best of Young British Novelists awards.\nHe followed this success with The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980); Life, The Universe and Everything (1982); So Long and Thanks for all the Fish (1984); and Mostly Harmless (1992).

I know I can't block her, but now I don't want to post anything. How do I handle this?\nA: This is about Facebook, not your mom. The often-shrugged-off truth about social media is that nothing is private. It's easy to forget this, so in a way, you're lucky that your mom is reminding you. Everything you post--comments, likes, photos--is freely available to future friends, employers, lovers etc unless blocked. That said, you can ask Mom again nicely to tone it down. You can also customize your controls so she can't see everything you post.\nQ: In which situations am I required to make a phone call versus send a text message?\nA: A text is for information--time, date, news. It's for the stuff you can keep short and sweet. A phone call is for analysis, discussion, opinion, and, if you must, gossip.\nQ: I'm always on Facebook, so I just send messages to friends through the site.

Los Angeles is the third largest city in the United States, with a population of three million. About sixteen percent of the city's population are black.\nNews of this election appeared on the front pages of newspapers everywhere in the United States. Here is how one major newspaper reported the event:\nLOS ANGELES ELECTS BRADLEY MAYOR UNSEATING YORTYBLACK WINS 56% OF VOTES\nBradley called his victory over Yorty \"the fulfillment   of a dream\". During his childhood and youth, people had kept telling him, \"You can't do this, you can't go there, because you are a Negro.\" Nevertheless he had won a decisive victory over a man who had been won 43.7 percent.\nLos Angeles voters have had many opportunities to judge. Thomas Bradley had to form an opinion of him. The son of a poor farmer Texas, he joined the Los Angeles police force in 1940. During his twenty-one years on the police force he earned a law degree by attending school at night. He was elected to the city council   ten years ago.\nAt the time of the Los Angeles election, three other American cities already had black mayors, but none of those cities had as large a population as Los Angeles. Besides, the percentage of blacks in those other cities was much larger. Cleveland, Ohio, had thirty-six percent black when Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1967. In the same year Richard Hatcher was elected mayor of Cary. In Newark, New Jersey, sixty percent of the population were black when Kenneth Gibson was elected in 1970. Thus election of a black mayor in those cities was not very surprising.\nIn Los Angeles thousands of white citizens voted for Thomas Bradley because they believed he would be a better mayor than the white candidate . Bradley had spent forty-eight of his fifty-five years in Los Angeles. Four years ago Bradley lost mayoral election to Yorty. This time Bradley won.\nQuestion: From the passage we can infer that people   _  .\nOptions: A: voted for Bradley because of his black color\nB: didn't care much about his color when they voted\nC: voted for him to give a chance to fulfill his dream\nD: voted for Bradley because they trust him",

In addition, this answer doesn't account for why 16 percent of voters didn't vote for him if they were voting based on his black color.

She is saving money to pay for college next year. \"I have to save for all my college money because my parents can't afford to co-sign on loans. So, I have to rely on my own savings.\"\nBut instead of putting her money in a local bank, Miss Scott began using SmartyPig, a web-based banking service.\nSmartPig was developed by Michael Ferrari with a friend in 2007. It is really all about helping people save for very specific goals, such as a wedding, a vocation or an IPhone.\nMICHAEL FERRARI said : \"For example, you want to save five thousand dollars for a vacation in three years. SmartyPig will actually calculate how much money you need to save every month. You don't have to move from your existing bank, we'll actually go in and withdraw those funds on the day you specify every month and we'll put it into your SmartyPig account, where it'll earn interest, as well.\"\nSmartyPig also enables outsiders to add money to the accounts of its users. \"Perhaps  a holiday is coming up or your birthday is coming up, and rather than getting a gift, your friends, your family can actually contribute to any of your SmartyPig goals.\"Mr.Ferrari said.

So our mother's characteristics leave an indelible impression, and we are forever after attracted to people with her facial features, body type, personality, even sense of humor. If our mother is warm and giving, as adults  we tend to be attracted to people who are warm and giving. If our mother is strong and even-tempered, we  are going to be attracted to a fair-minded strength in our mates.\nThe mother has an additional influence on her sons: she not only gives them clues to what they will find attractive in a mate, but also affects how they feel about women in general. So if she is warm and nice, her sons are going to think that's the way women are. They will probably grow up to be warm and responsive lovers and also be cooperative around the house.\nConversely, a mother who has a depressive personality, and is sometimes friendly but then suddenly turns cold and rejecting, may raise a man who becomes a \"dance-away lover\". Because he's been so scared about love from his mother, he's afraid of commitment and may pull away from a girlfriend for this reason.\nWhile the mother determines in large part what qualities attract us in a mate, it's the father--the first male in our lives--who influences how we relate to the opposite sex. Fathers have an enormous effect on their children's personalities and chances of marital happiness.\nJust as mothers influence their son's general feelings toward women, fathers influence their daughter's general feelings about men.

According to a new research, it has something to do with survival.\nIn a recently published paper, researchers concluded that expressions of fear and disgust changed the way human eyes gather and focus light. They argued that these changes were the result of evolutionary development and were intended to help humans survive, or at least discover, very different dangers.\nIn order to test their hypothesis  ,researchers examined two dozen volunteer college students with standard eye-exam equipment, and asked them to show expressions of fear and dislike. It was found that when the students widened their eyes, more light was admitted and their field of vision was expanded. When they wrinkled their noses in disgust, their eyes narrowed. This had the effect of blocking out more light but focusing on a specific point.\nAlthough some scientists have admitted that emotional expressions are intended primarily to communicate information, expressions of fear and disgust seem to perform different visual functions.\n\"Eye widening may help to find a potential danger that requires much attention. And this would agree with the hypothesized function of fear,\" said researchers. \"On the other hand, eye narrowing may help to distinguish and avoid different kinds of dangers, such as disease carriers and dirty foods. And this would agree with the hypothesized function of disgust.\"\nThese findings supported naturalist Charles Darwin's view that expressions are not necessarily for communication and are not arbitrary  .\"If our expressions were arbitrary, they would show little cross-cultural relationship.\" researchers said. \"But actually, our expressions probably have some universal   functional principles.\"\nQuestion: What is the hypothesis of the research in this text?\nOptions: A: Changes of human eyes lead to different emotional expressions.\nB: Evolutionary development helps humans survive different dangers.\nC: Emotional expressions affect how human eyes collect or focus light.\nD: Evolutionary development causes people to express different feelings.",

It was common knowledge that nobody on earth could physically run a mile in under 4 minutes. Professional runners had been trying for years, training to beat that time, but had failed every time.\nIn 1952, a British man by the name of Roger Bannister set a goal for himself: to be the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes. He trained intensely, and 2 years later, Bannister finally broke 4-minute barrier. And you know what? Soon after that, more and more people began to run the mile in under 4 minutes.

Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \"breaking up\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final.\nScientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death.\nTo illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal.\nQuestion: Scientists try to make the time of clinical death longer in order to\nOptions: A: slow down the body's metabolism.\nB: bring vital cells and tissues back to active life.\nC: cool the organism.\nD: delay the coming of biological death.",

It was said that the first thread was made from animal muscle and sinew  . And the earliest needles were made from bones. Since those early days, many people have been involved in the process of developing a machine that could do the same thing more quickly and with greater efficiency.\nCharles Wiesenthal, who was born in Germany, designed and received a patent on a double-pointed needle that eliminated the need to turn the needle around with each stitch   in England in 1755. Other inventors of that time tried to develop a functional sewing machine, but each design had at least one serious imperfection.\nFrenchman Barthelemy Thimonnier finally engineered a machine that really worked. However, he was nearly killed by a group of angry tailors when they burned down his garment factory. They feared that they would lose their jobs to the machine.\nAmerican inventor Elias Howe, born on July 9, 1819, was awarded a patent for a method of sewing that used thread from two different sources. Howe's machine had a needle with an eye at the point, and it used the two threads to make a special stitch called a lockstitch. However, Howe faced difficulty in finding buyers for his machines in America. In frustration, he traveled to England to try to sell his invention there. When he finally returned home, he found that dozens of manufacturers were adapting his discovery for use in their own sewing machines.\nIsaac Singer, another American inventor, was also a manufacturer who made improvements to the design of sewing machines. He invented an up-and-down-motion mechanism that replaced the side-to-side machines. He also developed a foot treadle   to power his machine. This improvement left the sewer's hands free. Undoubtedly, it was a huge improvement of the hand-cranked machine of the past. Soon the Singer sewing machine achieved more fame than the others for it was more practical. It could be adapted to home use and it could be bought on hire-purchase.

Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter \"i\" -- and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer -- which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -- adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear -- popular in the US and UK -- that plays music and video is called \"iTeddy\". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name \"i\".\nIn general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use.\nMost \"i\" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's \"i\", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name.\nBut it's hard to see what's so special about the letter \"i\". Why not use \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, \"i\" works because its meaning has become ambiguous. When Apple uses \"i\", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. \"Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,\" he says.\n\"However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability   .\"adds Thorne.\nClearly the letter \"i\" also agrees with the idea that the Western World is centered on the individual. Each person believes they have their own needs, and we love personalized products for this reason.\nAlong with \"Google\" and \"blog\", readers of BBC Magazines voted \"i\" as one of the top 20 words that have come to define the last decade.\nBut as history shows, people grow tired of fads .

Long  hair represented our freed inner selves.\nMy clients are often surprised when I asked them questions about their hairstyle--why they choose it, how else they've worn their hair, how they feel about it, and so on. However, while it may  seem  to  be  a  simple  topic,  even  today  our  hairstyles  still  have many  psychological  and emotional meanings.

The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things.\nThere is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated  and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \"straight ahead\" direction.

You jump out of bed, rush into the shower, into your clothes and out the door with hardly a moment to think. A stressful journey to work gets your blood pressure climbing. Once at the office, you glance through the newspaper with depressing stories or reports of disasters. In that sort of mood, who can get down to work, particularly some creative, original problem-solving work?\nThe way most of us spend our mornings is exactly opposite to the conditions that promote flexible, open-minded thinking. Imaginative ideas are most likely to come to us when we're unfocused. If you are one of those energetic morning people, your most inventive time comes in the early evening when you are relaxed. Sleepy people's lack of focus leads to an increase in creative problem solving. By not giving yourself time to tune into your wandering mind, you're missing out on the surprising solutions it may offer.\nThe trip you take to work doesn't help, either. The stress slows down the speed with which signals travel between neurons  , making inspirations less likely to occur. And while we all should read a lot about what's going on in the world, it would not make you feel good for sure, so put that news website or newspaper aside until after the day's work is done.\nSo what would our mornings look like if we wanted to start them with a full capacity for creative problem solving? We'd set the alarm a few minutes early and lie awake in bed, following our thoughts where they lead. We'd stand a little longer under the warm water of the shower, stopping thinking about tasks in favor of a few more minutes of relaxation. We'd take some deep breaths on our way to work, instead of complaining about heavy traffic. And once in the office--after we get a cup of coffee--we'd click on links not to the news of the day but to the funniest videos the web has to offer.\nQuestion: According to the author, we are more creative when we are   _  .\nOptions: A: focused\nB: relaxed\nC: awake\nD: busy",

Lastly, it advises taking some deep breaths on our way to work (instead of complaining about traffic) as well as choosing links not related to news or current events but rather something humorous like funny videos while at work instead.\n\n\nSo based on these statements, B is correct because according to the passage being relaxed will make you more likely for ideas and inspiration than if you were focused or busy with tasks ### B"

In it the majority of students will have conformed to   the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women--the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.\nIt might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity   is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.\nDiversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmes recruit   their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior   academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach--arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.\nProfessor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry.

It highlighted a medical mystery: why are some people more fit to handle the flu than others?\nBritish and American researchers think they have a clue. Reporting on Sunday in the journal Nature, researchers say they've found a gene that influences our ability to fight against flu illness. The gene, called IFITM3, is the \"important first line of defense\" against the flu, researcher Paul Kellam of Britain's Sanger Institute told Reuters.\nThe IFITM3 protein  prevents flu viruses from reproducing in cells. So, if you have a high amount of IFITM3, you're in luck, since it weakens the spread of the virus; a low amount can lead to more rapid viral reproduction, causing severe flu symptoms, according to Kellam.\nScientists first found in gene studies that IFITM3 played a role in resistance to flu and other viruses. In experiments in mice, they showed that when mice were raised to lack the IFITM3 gene and then infected with influenza, the animals developed more severe lung infection from flu, compared with mice that had the gene.\nTo figure out the role of IFTTM3 in humans, researchers then studied the IFITM3 genes of 53 patients with the flu in 2009-2010. They found that these patients were more likely to have a variant of the IFITM3 gene -- which makes people more vulnerable to flu -- compared with the general population. According to evidence from large genetic databases, about 1 in 400 people carries this IFITM3 variant, the BBC reports.\n\"Our research is important for people who have this variant as we predict their immune defenses could be weakened to some virus infections,\" said Kellam.\nThe Findings also suggest that a drug that functions as IFITM3 could help increase resistance to flu and other viruses, including deadly ones like H5N1 flu.\nQuestion: Which of the following can serve as the best title of the passage?\nOptions: A: Why Flu Hits Some People Harder\nB: How We Protect Ourselves From Flu\nC: How We Get Infected With Flu\nD: Why Flu Breaks Out Among People",

In November, 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America.\nThey then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they did not see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as the Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were staying in the Philippines, Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail round Africa.

So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people. Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.\nAccountability isn't hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences.\nOf the many values that hold civilization together --- honesty, kindness, and so on --- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law --- and, ultimately, no society.\nMy job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people's behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment.\nFortunately there are still communities --- smaller towns, usually --- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that declare: \"In this family certain things are not tolerated --- they simply are not done!\"\nYet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you annoy him.\nThe main cause of this breakdown is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it's the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged   upbringing, by the school that didn't teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn't provide a stable home.\nI don't believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged...\nQuestion: The writer is sorry to have noticed that   _  .\nOptions: A: people in large cities tend to excuse criminals\nB: people in small towns still stick to old discipline and standards.\nC: today's society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty\nD: people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal activities",

        "output": "The writer is a police officer and in the first paragraph, he says that society has approached crime with an attitude of blaming everything but the criminal himself.\nThis implies that people tend to blame circumstances rather than holding criminals accountable for their actions. The tone also suggests that this shift in attitudes is something negative as it hinders efforts to contain crime by imposing accountability on those who have never learned or refuse to impose it upon themselves.\nSo A is correct because today's larger cities are typically more liberal whereas smaller towns maintain stricter standards regarding morality and behavior (B), which does not match what the question asks us about current society at large(A). ### A"

The island was ruled by a beautiful woman called Tondalaya, the Fire Goddess of the Volcano. It was a low-budget  movie, but to me, it represented the perfect life. But through the years, Tondalaya was forgotten.\nThe week I turned 50, my marriage came to a sudden end. My house, furniture and everything I'd owned was sold to pay debts that I didn't even know existed. In a week I had lost my husband, my home and my parents who had refused to accept a divorce   in the family. I'd lost everything except my four teenage children. I used every penny I had to buy five plane tickets from Missouri to Hawaii. Everyone said I was crazy to think I could just run off to an island and survive. I was afraid they were right.\nI worked 18 hours a day and lost 30 pounds because I lived on one meal a day. One night as I walked alone on the beach, I saw the red orange lava   pouring out of Kilauea Volcano in the distance. It was time to live my imagination!\nThe next day, I quit my job, bought some art supplies and began doing what I loved. I hadn't painted a picture in 15 years. I wondered if I could still paint. My hands trembled the first time I picked up a brush. But before an hour had passed, I was lost in the colors spreading across the canvas   in front of me. And as soon as I started believing in myself, other people started believing in me, too. The first painting sold for $1,500.\nThe past six years have been filled with adventures. My children and I have gone swimming with dolphins, watched whales and hiked around the crater rim   of the volcano. We wake up every morning with the ocean in front of us and the volcano behind us. The dream I had more than 40 years is now reality.

This difference is quite surprising because productivity per hour worked is the same in the United States as it is in France, Spain and Germany, and it is growing at a similar speed. \n    In most countries and at most times in history, as people have become richer they have chosen to work less. In other words they have decided to \"spend\"a part of their extra income on a fuller personal life. Over the last fifty years Europeans have continued this pattern, and hours of work have fallen sharply. But not in the United States. We do not fully know why this is. One reason may be more satisfying work,or less satisfying personal lives.\n    Longer hours do of course increase the GDP  .

We call these balls Yuanxiao or Tangyuan. Obviously, they get the name from the festival itself. It is said that the custom of eating Yuanxiao originated during the Eastern Jin Dynasty in the fourth century, then became popular during the Tang and Song periods.\nThe fillings inside the dumplings or Yuansiao are either sweet or salty. Sweet fillings are made of sugar, Walnuts, sesame , osmanthus flowers , rose petals, sweetened tangerine peel, bean paste, or jujube paste . A single ingredient or any combination can be used as the filling . The salty variety is filled with minced meat , vegetables or a mixture.\nThe way to make Yuanxiao also varies between northern and southern China. The usual method followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls, make a hole, insert the filling, then close the hole and smooth out the dumpling by rolling it between your hands. In North China, sweet or nutmeat stuffing is the usual ingredient. The fillings are pressed into hardened cores, dipped lightly in water and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour. A layer of the flour sticks to the filling, which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour. And so it goes, like rolling a snowball, until the dumpling is the desired size.\nThe custom of eating Yuanxiao dumplings remains.

The real aim of an interview is to obtain the job you want. That often means rejecting job offers you don't want! So before you please an employer, be sure you want the job.\nMyth 2: Always please the interviewer\nNot true. Try to please yourself. Of course, don't be hostile--nobody wants to hire someone disagreeable. But there is plainly a muddle ground between being too ingratiating and being hostile.\nMyth 3: Try to control the interview\nNobody \"controls\" an interview. When someone tries to control us, we resent it. When we try to control others, they resent us. Remember you can't control what an employer thinks of you, just as he can't control what you think of him. So he is ready to give and take when being interviewed; never control the interview.\nMyth 4: Never interrupt the interviewer\nStudy the style of the effective conversationalists: they interrupt and are interrupted! An exciting conversation always makes us feel free--free to interrupt, to disagree, to agree enthusiastically. Just _ Try being yourself for a change.

Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1.\n    The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science.\n    Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin  . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1.\n    It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation   in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes.\n    Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng.\n    \"Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,\" said Cheng.\n    The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin color1 without damaging it like chemical treatment did on Michael Jackson. ks5u\nQuestion: The reason why Europeans are light-skinned is probably that   _\nOptions: A: they are born light-skinned people\nB: light-skinned Europeans have mutation in the gene for melanin production\nC: they have fewer activities outside\nD: they pay much attention to protecting their skin",

After immigrating from England to the USA, and an unsuccessful attempt to make a living as a farmer, he moved to Chicago, where he saw the reconstruction of the city after the disastrous  fire of 1871. In those days, it was nicknamed \"the Garden City\", almost certainly the source of Howard's name for his later building plan of towns. Returning to London, Howard developed his design in the 1880s and 1890s, _ ideas that were popular at the time, but creating a unique combination  of designs.\nThe nineteenth-century poor city was in many ways a terrible place, dirty and crowded; but it offered economic and social opportunities. At the same time, the British countryside was in fact equally unattractive: though it promised fresh air and nature, it suffered from agricultural depression  and it offered neither enough work and wages, nor much social life. Howard's idea was to combine the best of town and country in a new kind of settlement, the garden city. Howard's idea was that a group of people should set up a company, borrowing money to establish a garden city in the depressed countryside; far enough from existing cities to make sure that the land was bought at the bottom price.\nGarden cities would provide a central public open space, radial avenues and connecting industries. They would be surrounded by a much larger area of green belt, also owned by the company, containing not merely farms but also some industrial institutions. As more and more people moved in, the garden city would reach its planned limit-----Howard suggested 32,000 people; then, another would be started a short distance away. Thus, over time, there would develop a vast planned house collection, extending almost without limit; within it, each garden city would offer a wide rang of jobs and services, but each would also be connected to the others by a rapid transportation system, thus giving all the economic and social opportunities of a big city.\nQuestion: According to Howard, garden cities should be built  _  .\nOptions: A: as far as possible from existing cities\nB: in the countryside where the land was cheap\nC: in the countryside where agriculture was developed\nD: near cities where employment opportunities already existed",

The goal was to create a settlement located in an area that had economic opportunities, but also provided access to nature and fresh air. Garden cities were meant to be built far enough from existing cities so land could be purchased cheaply; they couldn't exist too close or else people would have no reason to move there. The answer is B because it matches Howard's idea for building garden cities with references in the article about how he wanted them established \"in depressed countryside\" where the land was cheap. ### B"

If your first instinct is to kill it, take a moment to think about all of the benefits insects provide to the environment.\nEntomologists, scientists who study insects, estimate that there are more than 800,000 species of insects found throughout the world. Only a few hundred of these insects are considered harmful. Mosquitoes, for example, are considered harmful. They bite humans and other animals, and their bites can cause skin pain and spread disease. Desert locusts also are considered harmful because they destroy crops causing billions of dollars in damage each year.\nHowever, the number of helpful insect species far outweighs the number of harmful species. Some insects make up a vital part of the food chain. Many different birds, reptiles, fish and even plants eat insects. There are also about 500 insects that people in various parts of the world eat. These insects are considered delicious food and prized for their high protein, mineral, and vitamin content. Other insects produce valuable commercial products such as silk, wax, and honey.\nOf all the insects, perhaps the most important are those that travel from flower to flower and pollinate  the plants they visit. Agriculture around the world would be very different without the bees, butterflies, moths, flies and wasps that pollinate many crops.

That is turning out to mean almost no protection at all. \nprefix = st1 /Idaho's Fish and Game department announced last week that it would allow 428 of the state's estimated 1,000 wolves to die this year. Some will die of natural causes. Most will be killed by hunters. \nIdaho officials argue that the remaining population will still be larger than the very small number to be protected in the original federal wolf recovery plans. But Idaho's Fish and Game department has overruled its own staff biologists, who for the good of the wolf population -- and the ecosystem  as a whole -- argued that more animals should be allowed to survive.\nSadly, in Idaho, wolves are nothing more than another game animal to be managed for the benefit of human hunters.\nBeginning on Sept. 15, any Idaho hunter with a hunting license and $10.50 for a wolf tag will be entitled to shoot one wolf, at least until the quota  of dead wolves in his region has been reached.

Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300.\n    A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres.

Another report, on Americans learning Russian, showed a direct improvement of ability over the age range tested; that is, the ability to learn increased as the age increased, from childhood to adulthood.\nThere are several possible explanations for these findings.

We all do silly things at times -- no one is immune -- but treating wild animals as lovely pets has to fall into a special category.

Dogs are pets because of thousands of years of domestication. Even farm animals, which have been kept by humans for thousands of years as well, aren't let in the house. So why keep animals that treat human contact with, at best, indifference(, ) and, at worst, violence?\nQuestion: TosaLeft thinks the wounded woman   _  .\nOptions: A: may have been drunk\nB: may be a little stupid\nC: was addicted to wine\nD: fed wine to the bear",

For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer?\nScientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \"commit suicide\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer.\nIn a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them.\nCancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet.\nDrinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics.\nSome believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,...\nQuestion: Why do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer?\nOptions: A: Ginger can destroy diseased cells in two different ways.\nB: Ginger is commonly considered as a kind of pain killer.\nC: Ginger warms people's bodies and helps them recover from operations.\nD: Ginger has no harmful side effects according to a large amount of medical research.",

That sounds like a line straight out of a fantasy novel, but it's one hundred percent real life! It's an unusual  sight--a crowd of butterflies flying around the eyes of yellow-spotted river turtles, trying to get a little tear.s. The poor turtles try to avoid them, hut the butterflies insist drinking  their tears until they've had their fill.\nThe butterflies are likely attracted to the turtles' tears because the liquid drops contain  salt, specifically sodium, an important mineral that is rare in the western Amazon rainforest, said Phil Torres, a scientist who does much of his research at the Tambopata Research Center in Peru and is associated with Rice Univtrsity. Turtles get plenty of sodium  through their largely carnivorous  diet.  Meat contains significant levels of the salt, Torres told LiveScience. But herbivores  butterflies sometimes .struggle to get this extra mineral source, he added.\nTorres explained the western Amazon rainforest is lower in sodium than many places on earth, because it t is over l,000 miles away from the Atlantic Ocean---a main source of salt. The region is also cut off from the mineral dirt blown towards the west from the Andes Mountains. Most of these windblown minerals are removed from the air by the rain before they have a chance to reach the western Amazon.\nIn fact, the butterflies have other sources to get sodium besides turtles' tears, which include animal urine , muddy river banks, sweaty clothes and so on.\nPeople can't help wondering if the process is painful for turtles. Torres said it's not completely clear, but the teary effort probably has little effect on the turtles, other than perhaps making them more vulnerable to their enemies like big cats, since the butterflies can block out their vision.\nQuestion: What is the best title of the passage?\nOptions: A: Turtles' enemy or turtles' fiends?\nB: A line straight out of a fantasy novel\nC: The western Amazon rainforest's turtles\nD: Amazonian butterflies drinking turtle tears",

Some say that Scottish and English writers used the expression a long time ago. Others say it was first used in the northeastern American states known as New England. The housewives of New England cut their apples in even slices. Then they filled pie pans with them in an organized way, row upon row. As one writer said, the women of New England loved to have everything in its place. This perhaps explains why it generally is believed that the expression \"apple-pie order\" began in New England.\nAnother old expression, \"apple of discord\", comes from ancient mythology ,however. The myth says that all the gods and goddesses were sitting around the table tocelebrate the marriage of Thetis and Peleus. One of the goddesses-Discord-was a troublemaker.\nShe threw away a golden apple on the table to be given as a prize to the most beautiful goddess.\nAt one time, the tomato was called a love apple. That was a mistake. This is how the mistake happened: In the sixteenth century, Spain brought the tomato from South America after Spanish explorers had landed there. Spain then sold the tomato to Morocco.  Italian traders carried it on to Italy. The Italian name for the tomato was \"pomo di Moro\"-apple of the Moors. When French growers brought it in from Italy, they thought \"di Moro\" meant\"d'amour\"-the French word for love. And so \"pomo di Moro\" became the apple of love.\nPeople believe many things about the apple. One belief is that it has great power of keeping people healthy. A very common expression is \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away. \"\nAnother belief is based on fact.  The expression is \"one rotten apple spoils the barrel. \"When an apple begins to go bad, it ruins all the other apples around it in the container. The expression has come to mean that one bad person in a group can cause everyone to act bad.\nQuestion: Which of the following can we know about the phrase \"apple-pie order\"?\nOptions: A: Everyone is sure of where it began.\nB: No one knows for sure where and when it began.\nC: It began in New England.\nD: It has been put into use recently.",

He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon film for children. When Walter Disney heard Nash's voice, he said, \"Stop! That's our duck!\"\nThe duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the film, The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat and worn his sailor jacket and hat. Later that year he became a star after an eight minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audiences   liked him because he was lazy and greedy, and because he lost his temper very easily. And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews. Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody, like Mickey.\nIn the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons.

The sight of Barney Clark----alive and conscious after trading his diseased heart for a metal-and-plastic pump----convinced the press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't. After monitoring production of the Jarvik-7, and reviewing its effects on the 150 or so patients (most of whom got the device as a temporary measure) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the machine was doing more to endanger lives than to save them. Last week the agency cancelled its earlier approval, effectively banning   the device.\nThe recall may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with the banned mode is that the tubes connecting it to an external power source created a passage for infection. Inventors are now working on new devices that would be fully placed, along with a tiny power pack, in the patient's chest. The first sample products aren't expected for another 10 or 20 years. But some people are already worrying that they'll work---and that America's overextended health-care programs will lose a precious $2.5 billion to $5 billion a year providing  _ for a  ly few dying patients.

After an hour's flight one of the scientists wrote in his book, \"Look here for probable metal.\" Walking across hilly ground, four scientists reported, \"This ground should be searched for metals.\" From an airplane over a hilly wasteland a scientist sent back by radio one word \"Uranium.\"\nNone of the scientists had X-ray eyes: they had no magic powers for looking down below the earth's surface. They were merely putting to use one of the newest methods of locating minerals in the ground---using trees and plants as signs that certain minerals may lie beneath the ground on which the trees and plants are growing.\nThis newest method of searching for minerals is based on the fact that minerals deep in the earth may affect the kind of bushes and trees that grow on the surface. \nAt Watson Bar Creek, a mineral search group gathered bags of tree seeds. Boxes were filled with small branches from the trees. Roots were dug and put into boxes. Each bag and box was carefully marked. In a scientific laboratory the parts of the forest trees were burned to ashes and tested. Each small part was examined to learn whether there were minerals in it.\nStudy of the roots, branches, and seeds showed no silver. But there were small amounts of gold in the roots and a little less gold in the branches and seeds. The seeds growing nearest to the tree trunk had more gold than those growing on the ends of the branches.\nIf the trees had not indicated that there was gold in the ground, the scientists would not have spent money to pay for digging into the ground.

Each time, he played himself.\nHawking, 71, is perhaps the world's most famous scientist after Albert Einstein. He has spent his whole life studying the beginning and the end of the universe, including the Big Bang   theory.\nThe Big Bang theory explains the early development of the universe. According to the theory, about 13.7 billion years ago everything was all squeezed  together in a tiny, tight little ball, and then the ball exploded. The results of that explosion are what we call the universe.\nHawking has always tried to make science more popular with people. His book: A Brief History of Time was published in 1988.

As a doctor, mother and scientist in child development, I believe there is nothing to recommend it, from the baby's point of view.\nMothers, doctors and nurse alike have no idea of where a baby's blood sugar level lies. All we know is that a low level is harmful to brain development and makes a baby easily annoyed. In this state, the baby is difficult to calm down and sleep is impossible. The baby asks for attention by crying and searching for food with its mouth.\nIt is not just unkind but also dangerous to say a four-hourly feeding schedule will make a baby satisfied. The first of the experts to advocate a strict clock-watching schedule was Dr Frederic Truby King who was against feeding in the night. I've never heard anything so ridiculous. Baby feeding shouldn't follow a timetable set by the mum. What is important is feeding a baby in the best way, though it may cause some inconvenience in the first few weeks.\nWell, at last we have _ research that supports demand feeding and points out the weaknesses of strictly timed feeding. The research finds out that babies who are fed on demand do better at school at age 5, 7, 11 and 14, than babies fed according to the clock. By the age of 8, their IQ scores are four to five percent higher than babies fed by a rigid timetable. This research comes from Oxford and Essex University using a sample of 10,419 children born in the early 1990s, taking account of parental education, family income, a child's sex and age, the mother's health and feeding style. These results don't surprise me. Feeding according to schedule runs the risk of harming the rapidly growing brain by taking no account of sinking blood sugar levels.\nI hope this research will put an end to advocating strictly timed baby feeding practices.\nQuestion: What does the research tell us about feeding a baby on demand?\nOptions: A: The baby will sleep well.\nB: The baby will have its brain harmed.\nC: The baby will have a low blood sugar level.\nD: The baby will grow to be wiser by the age of 8.",

So, automakers are focused on safety systems more than ever before. \nGiven the emphasis on improving safety, it's possible that well-known phrases such as \"live fast and die young\" may lose their meaning as innovative   new devices are built into cars and trucks and other things that go.\nMany of the new safety systems that are being added to high-end vehicles are computer-assisted technologies that transfer some of the vehicle's operations to the vehicle itself, rather than relying only on the driver's decision-making skills.  \nFor example, predictive brake assist is an in-vehicle feature that prepares the vehicle for braking when its built-in sensors detect a potential object ahead. The predictive brake assist basically places the vehicle's braking system on alert, which helps the system to slow down the car in as little time and as short a distance as possible.\nOther in-vehicle sensors will detect moving and still objects and will even distinguish the objects based on simple patterns, such as other vehicles vs. a person. \nWhat's more, built-in \"active systems\", i.e., predictive precollision   systems, will provide drivers with advance detection of potential contact between vehicles. These systems compute the   movement of the objects and detect possible dangerous intersections  .\nWhat technological developments have enabled innovations like predictive precollision systems? Essentially, these so-called active systems are the result of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. \nThese communication links allow highways to provide a vehicle's owners with services such as renting a movie during the trip, as well as reduce reaction delays when medical care is needed due to a crash.  \nDespite these new technologies, drivers cannot take safety for granted. \nUntil all vehicles are fully automated, it is the drivers themselves who are responsible for operating...\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is NOT true?\nOptions: A: Advanced safety systems make driving an easier job.\nB: Automakers pay more attention to safety system than before.\nC: New advanced technology makes the vehicle operation rely only on the vehicle itself.\nD: Drivers are still expected to drive carefully despite the built-in advanced safety system.",

I wanted to take a picture of it. These sea horses can be red or yellow-and-orange. The red pygmy sea horse lives on only one type of coral, a red sea fan that grows at depths below ninety feet.\nThis depth made the job even tougher. As the pressure on my body increased, I had to breathe harder, which used my air supply faster. So the deeper I dived, the shorter my time underwater.\nI had a lot to do. First, I had to find the pygmy sea horse's special type of fan .Then I had to look over the whole fan with my magnifying glass  to see if a sea horse lived on it. If not, I had to find another fan--all the while keeping an eye on my oxygen supply. The second fan rewarded me with a find.

However, it seems unlikely that someone began working so young (15/16) without any special circumstances such as poverty or child labor practices; therefore, we can assume Dai actually began work after turning 18 which gives him approximately 48 to 49 years of experience.\n\nThe answer must be determined based on what options align with this number range:  A = 5 years B= 10years C= 20years D 30years\n\n\nA could not be correct because being a tracker ### C"

And from business conference calls to chat lines, people often imagine they would recognize the speaker if they saw him or her. Seung-Jae Moon, a linguist of Korea found that, under certain conditions, they're actually right.\nMoon decided to see just how close those mental pictures match up with reality and if there was any relation to how people speak rather than what they are saying. He recorded 16 Koreans, half men and half women, reading the same passage, and took a full-body photo and head shot of each speaker. Then he played the tapes for 361 Koreans and 173 Americans who did not speak Korean and asked his subjects to match up voice and picture. The Korean participants viewing full-body photos were quite perceptive. A majority linked 6 of the 8 women to the correct voice and did so for 5 of the 8 men. With the Korean group shown only faces, accuracy plummeted, but more than 20 percent of the subjects selected the same incorrect picture. The Americans showed no accuracy in matching the foreign voices to photos, but they too were consistent in their errors. That disconnection reveals conflicting ideas of physical and vocal beauty. Moon asked people to pick a favorite face and voice. Seventy percent of the Koreans picked one voice, but there was no agreement on a face. Americans didn' t agree on either count. And over 65 percent of both Koreans and Americans did not match their favorite face with their favorite voice.\nMoon hopes to use software to break voices into components like pitch and hoarseness to narrow down which elements trigger certain mental pictures. \"If we can map which characteristics of the voice triggers what kind of linage, and it doesn't matter whether that image is the right or wrong one of the actual speaker, then we can create an image through voice,' he says. That capacity could help to create computer-synthesized...\nQuestion: People often think that they would   _   the speaker when they saw the speaker.\nOptions: A: understand\nB: recognize\nC: like\nD: surprise",

        "instruction": "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Where on Earth are you? Navigators   use lines of latitude and lines of longitude to locate places. Lines of latitude run east and west around Earth. On a map or globe, these lines appear as running sideways or horizontally. Lines of longitude run north and south around Earth. These lines go up and down or vertically on a map or globe. These lines create an imaginary graph paper on the Earth. They make it possible to find an absolute, or exact, location on Earth. They even allow us to give an absolute location to a place out in the middle of the ocean.\nLines of latitude tell us how far north or south of the Equator we are. Sailors have used primitive navigation tools, like astrolabes, since ancient times. The astrolabe uses the sun and stars to find an approximate location. Using such tools, they have been able to approximate their distance from the equator. Although their instruments may not have been the high quality we have now, they were incredibly accurate   for their time.\nLines of longitude tell us how far east or west of the prime meridian   we are. Sailors constantly looked for new ways to increase their navigation skills. Still, it wasn't until the 18th century that they were able to measure degrees of longitude. They would have been very envious of the technology available to us today.\nWhen we use lines of latitude and longitude together, we can get a very precise location. If we want to identify the absolute location of a point, we look where the latitude and longitude lines cross nearest to that point. We use the coordinates   for that point as its address. Many maps today include degrees of latitude and longitude.\nQuestion: _   make it possible for people to find an exact place on Earth.\nOptions: A: Latitudes\nB: Longitudes\nC: Navigators\nD: Sailors",
