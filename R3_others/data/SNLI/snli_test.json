The hypothesis states that these same two people are riding on a merry-go-round in an amusement park or carnival; there is no mention whatsoever of the backdrop being anything other than outside.

The second sentence does not accurately describe the situation described in the passage because it mentions that there are four people swimming in the ocean.
