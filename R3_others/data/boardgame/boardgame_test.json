Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the camel pays some $$$ to the fangtooth, then the conclusion that \"the fangtooth swims in the pool next to the house of the snake\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, leaves the houses occupied by the poodle, then the bulldog disarms the worm undoubtedly.

Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the starling: if it works fewer hours than before then it does not acquire a photograph of the goose for sure. Rule7: In order to conclude that the bison dances with the mouse, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the worm should fall on a square of the bison and secondly the fangtooth should capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the bison. Rule8: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals leaves the houses occupied by the dachshund, you can be certain that it will also acquire a photo of the goose. Rule9: Regarding the fangtooth, if it has a high salary, then we can conclude that it hides the cards that she has from the rhino.

Rule5: The wolf will not stop the victory of the woodpecker if it (the wolf) is in South America at the moment. Rule6: If the snake has a leafy green vegetable, then the snake does not negotiate a deal with the butterfly.
